<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="c">A LITTLE PILGRIM BEGINS A JOURNEY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was always room for one more in
the Home for Little Pilgrims. Especially was
this true of the nursery; not because the nursery
was so large, nor because there was the
least danger that the calico cats might be
lonesome, but Mrs. Moore loved babies. It
made no difference to her whether the wee
strangers were white or black, bright or stupid,
she treated them all alike. They were dressed,
undressed, bathed, fed and put to sleep at exactly
the same hours every day, that is, they
were laid in their cribs whenever it was time
for them to go to sleep. Little Pilgrims were
never rocked and Mrs. Moore had no time for
lullaby songs, whatever may have been her
inclination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet there came a night when Mrs. Moore
rocked a baby before the nursery fire and sung
to it all the songs she knew. That was the
night Marian Lee entered the Home with
bright eyes wide open. She not only had
her eyes open when she was placed in Mrs.
Moore's arms, but she kept them open and
somehow compelled Mrs. Moore to break her
own rules and do as she had never done with
a new baby.</p>

<p>To be sure, Marian Lee couldn't talk, having
started on her pilgrimage only six months before,
but in a way of her own, she declared
herself well pleased with the Home and with
the nursery in particular. She enjoyed her
bath and said so. The warm fire in the grate
pleased her and Mrs. Moore's face was lovely,
if a baby's ideas were of any account. The
trouble began when Marian was carried into
the still room where the sleeping Pilgrims
were, and placed in a crib. The minute her
head touched the pillow she began to cry.
When Mrs. Moore left her, she cried louder.
That awakened tiny Joe in the nearest crib
and when he began to wail, Bennie and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Johnnie, Sam and Katie, as well as half a
dozen others joined in the chorus. Not to
be outdone by these older Pilgrims, Marian
screamed louder than any of them until Mrs.
Moore took her back to the fire and quiet was
restored.</p>

<p>Now it was strictly against Mrs. Moore's
rules to humor a baby in that fashion, and
Mrs. Moore told Marian so, although she added
in the next breath, "Poor little dear." The
"poor little dear" was cooing once more and
there really seemed nothing to do but kiss,
and cuddle and rock the baby as her own
mother might have done. She was so unlike
the others in the Home; so soft, round and
beautiful.</p>

<p>"You are no ordinary baby, precious one,"
said Mrs. Moore, whereupon Marian laughed,
flourished her hands and seemed much pleased.
"I think," continued Mrs. Moore, as she kissed
the pink fists, "I think some one has talked
to you a great deal. My babies are different,
poor little things, they don't talk back as you
do."</p>

<p>Before long, the rows of white cribs in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
other room were forgotten and Mrs. Moore began
singing to Marian as though she were the
only baby in the big Home. Lullaby after
lullaby she sang while the fire burned low,
yet the baby would not sleep. Softly at last,
Mrs. Moore began a lullaby long unsung:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All the little birdies have gone to sleep,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Why does my pet so wide awake keep?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Peep, peep, go to sleep, peep, peep, go to sleep.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All the little babies their prayers have said,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Their mothers have tucked them up snugly in bed.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Peep, peep, go to sleep, peep, peep, go to sleep."</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the blue eyes closed, Mrs. Moore suddenly
realized it was but another Little Pilgrim
that she held and not her own baby so
often hushed to sleep by that old lullaby
many years ago. For the sake of that baby,
Mrs. Moore had loved all the motherless little
ones in the Home&mdash;all the unfortunate, neglected
waifs brought to its doors. She had
loved them impartially until that night. She
had never before asked who a baby was, nor
what its surroundings had been. Its future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
was her only concern. To care for each baby
while it was in the nursery and to be sure it
was placed in a good home when taken away,
was all she wished to know. No baby had
ever crept into Mrs. Moore's innermost heart
as Marian did that night. An hour later the
superintendent was surprised when Mrs. Moore
asked for the history of that latest Little Pilgrim.</p>

<p>"She's a fine child," mused the superintendent,
adding cheerfully, "we'll have no
trouble finding a home for her; I doubt if
she's here a month."</p>

<p>Mrs. Moore said nothing but she was sure
Marian would stay more than a month.
After she heard the superintendent's story,
she was more sure of it. Thus it happened
that tiny Joe, who was not a bit attractive, and
Bennie and Johnnie, who were disagreeable
babies if such a thing may be, and Sam and
Katie whose fathers and mothers were drunkards,
as well as a dozen other little waifs,
were given away long before Marian learned
to talk: Marian, the beautiful baby, was
somehow always kept behind Mrs. Moore's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
skirts. As the child grew older, she was still
kept in the background. The plainest dresses
ever sent in to Little Pilgrims, were given to
Marian. Her hair was kept short and when
special visitors were expected, she was taken
to the playground by an older girl. All this
time a happier baby never lived than Marian.
No one in the Home knew how tenderly Mrs.
Moore loved her. No one knew of the caresses
lavished upon her when the infant
Pilgrims were busy with their blocks or
asleep in their cribs.</p>

<p>At last the superintendent questioned Mrs.
Moore. He said it seemed strange that no
one wished to adopt so lovely a child. Mrs.
Moore explained. She told the superintendent
she hoped Marian would be claimed by
folks of her own, but if not&mdash;Mrs. Moore
hesitated at that and the superintendent
understood.</p>

<p>"We won't give her away," he promised,
"until we find the right kind of a mother
for her. That child shall have a good
home."</p>

<p>Too soon to please Mrs. Moore, Marian out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>grew
her crib and went to sleep in the dormitory.
The child was pleased with the
change, especially as Mrs. Moore tucked her
in bed and kissed her every night just as she
had done in the nursery. Marian was glad
to be no longer a baby. The dormitory with
its rows and rows of little white beds, delighted
the child, and to be allowed to sit up
hours after the babies were asleep was pure
joy.</p>

<p>The dining-room was another pleasure. To
sit down to dinner with two hundred little
girls and boys and to be given one of the two
hundred bright bibs, filled her heart with
pride. The bibs certainly were an attraction.
Marian was glad hers was pink. She
buttoned it to her chair after dinner just as
she saw the others do.</p>

<p>One thing troubled Marian. She wished
Mrs. Moore to sit at the table beside her and
drink milk from a big, white mug. "Do
childrens always have dinner all alone?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Instead of answering the child, Mrs. Moore
told her to run away and play. Then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
looked out of the window for a long, long time.
Perhaps she had done wrong after all in keeping
the baby so long in a "Home with a
capital H."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="c">MARIAN'S FIRST DAY IN SCHOOL</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no kindergarten in the Home
for Little Pilgrims when Marian was a baby.
The child was scarcely five when she marched
into the schoolroom to join the changing ranks
of little folks who were such a puzzle to their
teacher. Every day one or more new faces
appeared in that schoolroom and every day
familiar faces were gone. For that reason
alone it was a hard school to manage.</p>

<p>The teacher, who had been many years in
the Home, smiled as she found a seat for
Marian in the front row. Marian at least
might be depended upon to come regularly to
school: then, too, she would learn easily and
be a credit to her instructor. Plain dresses
and short hair might do their worst, the face
of the child attracted attention. The teacher
smiled again as Marian sat in the front seat
before her, with hands folded, waiting to see
what might happen next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Roll call interested the child. She wondered
why the little girls and boys said
"Present" when the teacher read their
names from a big book. Once in a while
when a name was called, nobody answered.
Finally the teacher, smiling once more, said,
"Marian Lee." The little girl sat perfectly
still with lips tightly closed.</p>

<p>"You must say 'present' when your name
is called," suggested the teacher.</p>

<p>No response.</p>

<p>"Say present," the teacher repeated.</p>

<p>"But I don't like this kind of play,"
Marian protested, and then wondered why
all the children laughed and the teacher
looked annoyed.</p>

<p>"But you must say present," the young
lady insisted and Marian obeyed, though she
thought it a silly game.</p>

<p>The things that happened in the schoolroom
that morning were many and queer. A
little boy had to stand on the floor in front
of the teacher's desk because he threw a
paper wad. Then when the teacher wasn't
looking he aimed another at Marian and hit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
her on the nose and when Marian laughed
aloud, the teacher, who didn't know what
happened, shook her head and looked cross.
It distressed Marian so to have the teacher
look cross that she felt miserable and wondered
what folks went to school for anyway.
A few moments later, she knew. The primer
class was called and Marian, being told to do
so, followed a dozen Little Pilgrims to the
recitation seat where she was told that children
go to school to learn their letters.
Marian knew her letters, having learned
them from the blocks in the nursery.</p>

<p>"You must learn to read," advised the
teacher, and Marian stared helplessly about
the schoolroom. She felt sure it wouldn't be
a bit of fun to learn to read. Nor was it, if
her first lesson was a sample.</p>

<p>It wasn't long before Marian was tired of
sitting still. She wasn't used to it. At last
she remembered that in her pocket was a
china doll, an inch high. On her desk was
the new primer. The cover was pasteboard
and of course one could chew pasteboard. The
china doll needed a crib and as there seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
nothing to make a crib of but the cover of
her primer, Marian chewed a corner of it,
flattened it out and fitted the doll in. It
pleased her, and she showed it to the little
girl in the next seat. Soon the teacher
noticed that Marian was turning around
and showing her primer to all the children
near, and the children were smiling.</p>

<p>"Marian, bring your book to me," said the
teacher. Then there was trouble. Little Pilgrims
had to be taught not to chew their
books. The teacher gave Marian what one
of the older girls called a "Lecture," and
Marian cried.</p>

<p>"I didn't have anything to do," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Nothing to do?" exclaimed the teacher,
"why, little girl, you should study your lesson
as you see the other children doing. That
is why you are in school&mdash;to study."</p>

<p>Marian went to her seat, but how to study
she didn't know. She watched the other children
bending over their books, making noises
with their lips, so she bent over her primer
and made so much noise the teacher told her
she must keep still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Marian," said the young lady,
"what makes you so naughty? I thought
you were a good little girl!"</p>

<p>Poor Marian didn't know what to think.
Tears, however, cleared her views. She decided
that as going to school was a thing that
must be endured because Mrs. Moore would be
displeased otherwise, it would do no good to
make a fuss. She would draw pictures on her
slate or play with the stones in her pocket&mdash;anything
to pass the time. There was a great
deal in knowing what one could or could not
do safely, and Marian learned that lesson
faster than she learned to read. When she
was dismissed that afternoon, the little girl
flew to the nursery to tell Mrs. Moore about
her first school day. Soon after when Marian
ran laughing into the hall on her way to the
playground, she met Janey Clark who sat behind
her in school.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Moore your ma?" asked Janey.</p>

<p>"What's a ma?" inquired Marian, seizing
Janey's two hands.</p>

<p>"A ma," was the reply, "why a ma is a
mother. Is Mrs. Moore your mother?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe," agreed Marian. "Oh, no, she
isn't either. I know all about mothers, we
sing about 'em, of course. I guess I never
had one."</p>

<p>"My mother just died," declared Janey,
tossing her head in an important way that
aroused Marian's envy.</p>

<p>"Well, mine died too!" responded Marian.</p>

<p>"Did you have a funeral?" persisted
Janey.</p>

<p>"Did you?" Marian cautiously inquired.</p>

<p>"Well I should say yes," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then I did too," observed Marian.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Janey, "that's nothing
to brag of; I don't suppose there's anybody in
this Home that got here unless all their folks
died dead. We are here because we don't belong
anywhere else, and we are going to be
given away to folks that'll take us, pretty
soon."</p>

<p>That was too much for Marian. "Why,
Janey Clark, what a talk!" she exclaimed,
then turning, she ran back to the nursery.</p>

<p>"Nanna, Nanna!" she cried, "where's my
mother?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Moore almost dropped a fretful baby
at the question.</p>

<p>"Did I ever have a mother?" continued
the child, whose dark blue eyes looked black
she was so much in earnest. "I thought
mothers were just only in singing, but Janey
Clark had a mother and she died, and if Janey
Clark had a mother, I guess I had one too that
died."</p>

<p>The fretful baby was given to an assistant
and Mrs. Moore took Marian in her lap.
"What else did Janey tell you?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, Janey said that all of us childrens
are going to be gived away to folks. Mrs.
Moore, did all the childrens that live here
have mothers that died?"</p>

<p>"Not all of them, Marian, some of the
mothers are living and the children will go
back to them: but your mother, little girl,
will never come back for you. God took her
away when He sent you to us. We keep little
children here in our home until we find
new fathers and mothers for them. Sometimes
lovely mothers come here for little girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
like you. How is it, Marian, do you want a
mother?"</p>

<p>The child nodded her head and looked
so pleased Mrs. Moore was disappointed. It
would be hard enough to part with the child
anyway, but to think she wished to go was
surprising.</p>

<p>Two soft arms stole around Mrs. Moore's
neck. "I'm going to have you for my
mother," Marian explained, "and I'm going
to live here always. I don't want to be gived
away."</p>

<p class="c">SHE GOES TO CHURCH</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Janey Clark</span> was taken ill one day and
was carried to the hospital. When she returned
months afterward, she had something
to tell Marian.</p>

<p>"You want to get yourself adopted," was
her advice. "I'm going to, first chance I get.
When I was too well to stay in the hospital
and not enough well to come home, a pretty
lady came and said would I like to go to her
house and stay until I was all better."</p>

<p>"Did she 'dopt you?" questioned Marian.</p>

<p>"No, of course not, or I could have stayed
at her house and she would be my mother.
She didn't want to keep me but only to borrow
me so the children she is aunt to would
know about Little Pilgrims and how lucky it
is not to be one their own selves. And at
her house," continued Janey, "if you liked
something they had for dinner pretty well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
you could have a second helping, if you would
say please. You better believe I said it when
there was ice cream. And the children she
was aunt to took turns dividing chocolate
candy with me, and the only trouble was they
gave me too much and made me sick most all
the time. What do you think! One day a
girl said she wished I was a little cripple like
a boy that was there once, because she liked
to be kind to little cripples and wash their
faces. Wasn't she just lovely? Oh, Marian,
I want to be adopted and have a mother like
that lady and a room all my own and everything."</p>

<p>"But I would rather live with Mrs. Moore,"
objected Marian. "I've picked her out for my
mother."</p>

<p>"All right for you, stay here if you want
to," agreed Janey, "but I'm not, you just wait
and see."</p>

<p>Janey Clark was adopted soon after and
when Marian was invited to visit her, she
changed her mind about living forever in the
Home for Little Pilgrims. Mrs. Moore promised
to choose a mother for her from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
many visitors to the Home, yet she and
Marian proved hard to suit.</p>

<p>"I want a mother just like my Nanna,"
said Marian to the superintendent, who
agreed to do all he could to find one. In
spite of his help Marian seemed likely to
stay in the Home, not because no one wanted
her but because the child objected to the
mothers who offered themselves. All these
months the little girl was so happy and contented
the superintendent said she was like a
sunbeam among the Little Pilgrims and if
the school-teacher had some ideas that he
and Mrs. Moore didn't share, she smiled and
said nothing.</p>

<p>In time, Marian talked of the mother she
wished to have as she did of heaven&mdash;of
something beautiful but too indefinite and far
away to be more than a dream. One never-to-be-forgotten
morning, the dream took shape.
A woman visited the Home, leading a little
girl by the hand. A woman so lovely the
face of the dullest Little Pilgrim lighted as
she passed. It was not so much the bright
gold of her hair, nor the blue eyes that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>tracted
the children, but the way she smiled
and the way she spoke won them all.</p>

<p>She was the mother for whom Marian had
waited. It didn't occur to the child that the
woman might not want her.</p>

<p>It was noon before the strangers were
through visiting the chapel, the schoolroom,
the nursery and the dormitories.
Like a shadow Marian had followed them
over the building, fearing to lose sight of her
chosen mother. On reaching the dining-room
the woman and child, with the superintendent,
stood outside the door where they watched the
Little Pilgrims march in to dinner. Noticing
Marian, the superintendent asked her why she
didn't go to the table, and Marian tried to tell
him but couldn't speak a word. The man was
about to send her in the dining-room when he
caught the appealing look on the child's face.
At that moment the stranger turned. Marian
seized her dress and the woman, glancing
down, saw the dear little one and stooping,
kissed her.</p>

<p>The superintendent smiled but Marian began
to cry as the woman tried ever so gently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to release her dress from the small, clinging
fingers.</p>

<p>"We must go now," the stranger said, "so
good-bye, dear child."</p>

<p>"I'm going with you," announced Marian.
"I want you for my mother."</p>

<p>"But, don't you see, I have a little girl?
What could I do with two?" remonstrated
the woman. "There, there," she continued,
as Marian began to sob piteously, "run in
to dinner and some day I will come to see
you again. Perhaps they may let you visit
my little girl and me before long. Would
you like that?"</p>

<p>"No, no," wailed Marian, "I want you for
my mother."</p>

<p>"Come, Marian, sweetheart, let's go find
Mrs. Moore," suggested the superintendent,
taking her by force from the visitor, whose
eyes filled with tears at the sight of little outstretched
arms. For years afterwards there
were times when that woman seemed to feel
the clinging fingers of the Little Pilgrim
who chose her for her mother. She might
have taken her home. The next time she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
called to inquire for the child, Marian was
gone.</p>

<p>An unexpected thing happened as Marian
was borne away to the nursery. The stranger's
little girl cried and would not be comforted
because she couldn't stay and have
dinner with the Little Pilgrims. She was
still grieving over her first sorrow after Mrs.
Moore had succeeded in winning back the
smiles to the face of her precious Marian.</p>

<p>"Well, I know one sure thing," declared
the Little Pilgrim as she raised her head
from Mrs. Moore's shoulder and brushed away
the tears. "I know that same mother will
come and get me some time and take me home
and then you will come and live with me&mdash;and
won't it be lovely! Let's have some
dinner, I'm hungry!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Moore smiled and sighed at the same
time, but she ordered a luncheon for two
served in the nursery and Marian's troubles
vanished: also the luncheon.</p>

<p>The next time the superintendent saw the
child, she was sitting on the nursery floor
singing to the babies. He was surprised and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
pleased when he heard the sweet, clear voice
and straightway sought Mrs. Moore.</p>

<p>"Let me take her Sunday," he suggested.
"I didn't know our Marian was a singer."</p>

<p>"Are you going into the country?" asked
the nurse.</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Moore, not this time. We expect
to have services in one of the largest
churches right here in the city. We have
made special arrangements and I shall take
twenty-five of the best singers in the Home
with me. Marian will have plenty of company."</p>

<p>"She is young," objected Mrs. Moore.</p>

<p>The superintendent laughed. "Petey
Ross," said he, "was two years old when
he made his first public appearance on the
platform; Marian is nearly six."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Mrs. Moore, "that is true and
I remember that Petey Ross was adopted and
in less than a week after that first appearance.
Marian," she continued, "come here, darling.
Do you want to go to a big church with the
children next Sunday and sing one of the
songs you and I sing to the babies?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Nanna, what for?"</p>

<p>"Because the superintendent wishes you to.
Every Sunday he takes some of our little
boys and girls away to sing in the different
churches, where he tells the people all about
the Home for Little Pilgrims."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, now I know," declared Marian.
"Janey Clark used to go and sing. She said
that was the way to get yourself adopted. I'd
like to go if I don't have to get adopted and
if Nanna may go too."</p>

<p>"All right, Marian, I will go," assented
Mrs. Moore, "and nobody shall adopt you
unless you wish it. Now run back to the
babies. Little Ned and Jakey are quarreling
over the elephant. Hurry, Marian, or its ears
will be gone."</p>

<p>"She'll demand a salary in another year,"
remarked the superintendent, watching the
little girl's successful management of the
babies.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't know how to get along without
her," said Mrs. Moore, "and yet it isn't
right to let her grow up here."</p>

<p>Sunday morning it would have been hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to find a happier child than Marian anywhere
in the big city. She had never been in a
church before and quickly forgot her pretty
white dress and curls in the wonder of it all.
She sat on the platform, a radiant little Pilgrim
among the twenty-five waifs. Soon the
church was filled. After the opening exercises
the service was turned over to the superintendent
of the Home for Little Pilgrims.
He made a few remarks, and then asked
Marian to sing. Pleased by the friendly faces
in the pews and encouraged by Mrs. Moore's
presence, Marian sang timidly at first, then
joyously as to the babies in the nursery.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'I am Jesus' little lamb</span><br />
<span class="i0">Happy all the day I am,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Jesus loves me this I know</span><br />
<span class="i0">For I'm His lamb.'"</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As she went on with the song, the little girl
was surprised to see many of the audience in
tears. Even Mrs. Moore was wiping her eyes,
although she smiled bravely and Marian knew
she was not displeased. What could be the
matter with the folks that bright Sunday morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>ing?
Janey Clark said everybody always cried
at funerals. Perhaps it was a funeral. At the
close of her song Marian sat down, much
puzzled. After Johnnie Otis recited the poem
he always recited on Visitors' Day at school,
"The Orphan's Prayer," all the Little Pilgrims,
Marian included, were asked to sing
their chapel song. What was there sad about
that, Marian wondered. She always sang it
over and over to the babies to make them
stop crying.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It is all for the best, oh, my Father,</span><br />
<span class="i2">All for the best, all for the best."</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Little Pilgrims were seated, the
superintendent made a speech to which
Marian listened. For the first time in her
life she knew the meaning of the Home for
Little Pilgrims. She understood at last all
that Janey Clark had tried to tell her. No
wonder the people cried. Marian stared at
the superintendent, longing and dreading to
hear more. Story after story he told of
wrecked homes and scattered families; of
little children, homeless and friendless left
to their fate upon the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whatever may be the causes which bring
these waifs to our doors, remember," said he,
"the children themselves are not to blame.
It is through no fault of theirs their young
lives have been saddened and trouble has
come upon them while your little ones are
loved and cared for in comfortable homes."</p>

<p>The superintendent grew eloquent as he
went on. How could it be, Marian wondered,
that she had never known before what a sad,
sad place was the Little Pilgrims' Home?
Where did her mother die and where was her
father? Perhaps he was in the dreadful prison
mentioned by the superintendent. It was
such a pitiful thing to be a Little Pilgrim.
Marian wondered how she had ever lived so
long. Oh, if she could change places with
one of the fortunate little ones in the pews.
The superintendent was right. Every little
girl needed a father and mother of her own.
She wanted the lovely mother who had passed
her by. What was the superintendent saying?
something about her? The next thing
Marian knew the man had taken her in his
arms and placed her upon the little table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
beside him. She thought he said "'For of
such is the Kingdom of Heaven,'"&mdash;she
wasn't sure.</p>

<p>In the quiet moment that followed, Marian
looked all over the church for the mother of
her dreams. Maybe she was there and perhaps
she would take her home. If she could
only see that one face for a moment.</p>

<p>"I am going to ask our little girl for
another song," the superintendent said, telling
Marian what to sing. The child hesitated,
then looked appealing towards Mrs.
Moore. She had forgotten her during the
speech&mdash;dear, kind Mrs. Moore.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," whispered the superintendent,
whereupon to the surprise of every
one in the church, Marian put her head upon
his shoulder and sobbed aloud, "I don't want
to be a Little Pilgrim any more! Oh, I don't
want to be a Little Pilgrim any more!"</p>

<p>Another second and Mrs. Moore's arms were
around the child and the superintendent was
alone on the platform with the twenty-five.</p>

<p>"He told me to take you for a walk in the
park," whispered Mrs. Moore, "so don't cry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Marian, and we will leave the church quickly
as we can. We will talk about the Little
Pilgrims out in the sunshine where the birds
are singing and we can see the blue sky."</p>

<p>Mrs. Moore would have been tempted to
have stayed in the church had she known the
superintendent's reason for wishing her to
take the child away; nor would the good man
have done as he did, could he have guessed
the immediate consequences. When Marian
was gone, the superintendent told her story
effectively. She might have had her choice
of many homes within a week had it not been
for the appearance of Aunt Amelia.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="c">AUNT AMELIA</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no question about it. Aunt
Amelia had a perfect right to claim the child.
The superintendent was sorry to admit it, but
what could he do? Mrs. Moore was heartbroken,
but she was powerless. The proofs
were positive. Aunt Amelia's husband and
Marian Lee's father were half-brothers and
here was Aunt Amelia insisting upon her
right to do her duty by the child.</p>

<p>Marian never heard of Aunt Amelia until
it was all over and the superintendent sent for
her. She came dancing into the office, her
face aglow until she saw Aunt Amelia. Then
the sunshine faded from her eyes and she
shrank past the stranger, scarcely breathing
until the superintendent's arms were about
her. From that safe shelter she surveyed
Aunt Amelia.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the woman's appearance
to inspire confidence in a little child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
She was tall, thin, bloodless. One felt conscious
of the bones in her very forehead.
She wore her scant, black hair in wiry crimps
parted in the middle. Her eyes were the
color of stone, while her lips formed a thin,
pale lone line closing over projecting front
teeth. There was a brittle look about her
ears and nose as though a blow might shatter
them. Angles completed the picture.</p>

<p>"You say you have a child of your own,
Mrs. St. Claire?" The superintendent asked
the question doubtfully. It seemed probable
that his ears had deceived him.</p>

<p>"I have," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then Marian will be sure of a playmate."
The man seemed talking to himself.</p>

<p>"If she behaves herself&mdash;perhaps," was the
response.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded the superintendent.</p>

<p>"I think I expressed myself clearly," said
Mrs. St. Claire. "If Marian behaves and is
worthy of my little daughter's companionship,
we may allow them to play together
occasionally."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does she want to 'dopt me?" whispered
Marian; "tell her no, quick&mdash;I got to go back
to the nursery. Put me down."</p>

<p>"I am your Aunt Amelia," announced
the woman, "and I have come to take you
to Michigan to live with your Uncle George
and me."</p>

<p>"Where did I get any Uncle George?"
asked Marian, turning to the superintendent.</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary to give a mere child
too much information," put in Mrs. St. Claire;
"it is enough for her to know that she has
relatives who are willing to take her and do
their duty by her."</p>

<p>Regardless of this the man answered one of
the questions he saw in Marian's solemn blue
eyes.</p>

<p>"Your uncle and aunt," he explained, "are
visiting in the city; they were in church last
Sunday when you sang. When relatives come
for Little Pilgrims, Marian, we have to let
them go."</p>

<p>"You will not send me away with&mdash;her!"
exclaimed the child, terror and entreaty expressed
in the uplifted face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear child, we must."</p>

<p>"But I won't go, I won't go," cried Marian,
clinging to the superintendent for protection.
"Oh, you won't send me away, Mrs. Moore
won't let them take me&mdash;I won't go! Please
let me stay until the pretty mother comes
again and I will ask her to take me and I
know she will. Oh, if you love me, don't
send me away with her!"</p>

<p>"It is just as I told my husband Sunday
morning," remarked Mrs. St. Claire as the
superintendent tried to soothe Marian's violent
grief. "I said the child was subject to
tantrums. It is sad to see such traits cropping
out in one so young. Lack of training
may have much to do with it. Other influences&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, madam," interrupted the superintendent,
"you forget that this little one
has been with us since she was six months
old. Mrs. Moore has been a mother to her in
every sense of the word. It is only natural
that she dreads going among strangers. She
is a good little girl and we all love her.
Hush, sweetheart," he whispered to the sob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>bing,
trembling child, "perhaps your aunt
may decide to leave you with us."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I won't&mdash;won't go," protested Marian,
"I&mdash;I won't go, I won't go!"</p>

<p>"Are you willing, madam, to give this
child to us?" continued the superintendent;
"perhaps you may wish to relinquish your
claim, under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"I never shrink from my duty," declared
the woman, rising as she spoke, grim determination
in every line of her purple gown; "my
husband feels it a disgrace to find his brother's
child in an orphan asylum. She cannot
be left in a charitable institution while we
have a crust to bestow upon her. She will
take nothing from this place except the articles
which belonged to her mother. I will
call for the child at eight this evening. Good-morning,
sir."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I won't go&mdash;I&mdash;won't go! You&mdash;you
needn't come for me!" Marian had the last
word that time.</p>

<p>The babies were left to the care of assistant
nurses that afternoon. Mrs. Moore held
Marian and rocked her as on that night so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
long before when she became a little Pilgrim.
For some time neither of them spoke and
tears fell like rain above the brown head
nestled in Mrs. Moore's arms. Marian was the
first to break the silence. "I&mdash;I won't go, I
won't go," she repeated between choking sobs,
"I&mdash;I won't go, I won't go, she'll find out she
won't get me!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Moore tried to think of something to
say. Just then a merry voice was heard singing
in the hall outside,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It is all for the best, oh, my Father,</span><br />
<span class="i2">All for the best, all for the best."</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Will they let me come to see you every
day?" asked Marian when the singer was beyond
hearing. "Will they?" she repeated as
Mrs. Moore made no answer. "Where is
Michigan, anyway? What street car goes out
there?"</p>

<p>It was some time before Mrs. Moore could
speak. Her strongest impulse was to hide
the precious baby. What would become of
her darling among unloving strangers? Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
would teach her right from wrong? Suddenly
Mrs. Moore realized that in days to come there
might be time enough for tears. There were
yet a few hours left her with the little girl
which she must improve.</p>

<p>Gently and tenderly she told Marian the
truth. Michigan was far, far away. She
must go alone, to live among strangers&mdash;yet
not alone, for there was One in heaven who
would be with her and who would watch over
her and love her always, as He had in the
Home. Poor Marian heard the voice but the
words meant nothing to her until long afterwards.
Mrs. Moore herself could never recall
just what she said that sad day. She knew
she tried to tell Marian to be brave, to be
good; to tell the truth and do right: but more
than once she broke down and wept with her
darling.</p>

<p>When Mrs. St. Claire called at eight, she
was greeted by a quiet, submissive child who
said she was ready to go. More than that,
the little thing tried to smile as she promised
to be a good girl. Perhaps the smile wouldn't
have been so easily discouraged if Mrs. St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Claire had kissed the swollen, tear-stained
face, or had said one comforting word.</p>

<p>The time of parting came. When it was
over, Mrs. Moore lifted the sobbing child into
the carriage. Then she knew that in spite of
the stars the night was dark.</p>

<p class="c">MARIAN'S NEW HOME</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second day of the journey to the new
home, Marian laughed aloud. She had slept
well the night before and had taken a lively
interest in everything she saw from the time
she was awakened by the first glimpse of daylight
through the sleeper windows. Not that
she was happy, far from it, but it was something
that she wasn't utterly miserable.</p>

<p>Uncle George was pleasanter than his wife,
and although he said little from behind his
newspaper, that little was encouraging: his
tones were kind.</p>

<p>Ella St. Claire, the cousin, three years
younger than Marian, was inclined to be
friendly. Left to themselves the children
might have had a delightful time, but Mrs.
St. Claire had no intention of leaving the two
to themselves; it was not part of her plan.
Marian made several attempts to get acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and Ella kept edging away from her mother,
until in the middle of the forenoon, Mrs. St.
Claire remarked that if she wished to have
any peace she must separate the children.
Accordingly she took Ella by the hand and
went several seats back, leaving Marian alone.
As she left, Ella begged for a cooky.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry, too," added Marian.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Claire gave Ella the cooky and
passed a bit of dry bread to Marian.</p>

<p>"If you please," suggested Marian, "I like
cookies, too."</p>

<p>"You will take what I give you or go without,"
said Mrs. St. Claire; "you can't be starving
after the breakfast you ate in Buffalo."</p>

<p>Marian, sorry she had spoken, dropped from
sight in the high-backed seat. There was a
lump in her throat and so deep a longing for
the Home she had left it was hard to keep the
tears back. Just then an old man began snoring
so loud the passengers smiled and Marian
laughed in spite of herself. Having laughed
once she grew more cheerful. There were
green fields and bits of woodland to be seen
from the car windows, cows, sheep, bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
flowers growing along the track, country roads
and little children playing in their yards, sitting
on fences and waving their hands to the
passing train. Wonderful sights for a child
straight from the Little Pilgrims' Home in a
big city.</p>

<p>Uncle George, growing tired of his paper,
crossed the aisle and sat down beside his niece.
Marian looked up with a happy smile. "I
wish the cars would stop where the flowers
grow," she said, "I'd like to pick some."</p>

<p>"The cars will stop where the flowers grow,"
answered the man. "When we get home you
will live among the flowers; Marian, will you
like that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, goody!" the child exclaimed. "Oh,
I am so glad! May I pick some flowers?"</p>

<p>"Indeed you may, and we'll go to the
woods where the wild flowers are. Were you
ever in the woods?"</p>

<p>Marian shook her head. "I've been in the
Public Gardens and on the Common, though,
and I know all about woods."</p>

<p>"Who told you about the woods?"</p>

<p>"Nanna&mdash;Mrs. Moore."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was she your nurse?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle George, she was my everybody.
I love her more than anybody else in the
world. She is the prettiest, nicest one in the
Home."</p>

<p>"See here, little girl," interrupted the man,
"will you promise me something?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"I want you to do me this one favor.
Don't tell any one you were ever in an orphan's
home."</p>

<p>The child was silent. "What will I talk
about?" she finally asked.</p>

<p>Uncle George laughed. "Take my advice
and don't say much about anything," was his
suggestion. "You'll find it the easiest way to
get along. But whatever you talk about,
don't mention that Home."</p>

<p>Later, Aunt Amelia added a word on the
same subject, but in a manner so harsh Marian
became convinced that to have lived in an
orphan asylum was a disgrace equal perhaps
to a prison record. She determined never to
mention the Home for Little Pilgrims. Janey
Clark must have known what she was talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
about and even Mrs. Moore, when questioned,
had admitted that if she had a little girl it
would make her feel sad to know she lived in
a Home. Before the journey was ended
Marian was thankful that relatives had claimed
her. Perhaps if she tried hard, she might be
able to win Aunt Amelia's love. She would
be a good little girl and do her best.</p>

<p>One thing Marian learned before she had
lived ten days with Aunt Amelia. The part of
the house where she was welcome was the outside.
Fortunately it was summer and the new
home was in a country town where streets
were wide and the yards were large. Back of
Aunt Amelia's garden was an orchard, and
there or in the locust grove near by, Marian
passed untroubled hours. The front lawn,
bordered with shrubs and flower beds, was
pleasing enough, but it wasn't the place for
Marian who was not allowed to pick a blossom,
although the pansies begged for more
chance to bloom. She could look at the pansies
though, and feel of the roses if Aunt
Amelia was out of sight. How Marian loved
the roses&mdash;especially the velvety pink ones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
She told them how much she loved them, and
if the roses made no response to the endearing
terms lavished upon them, at least they never
turned away, nor said unkind, hard things to
make her cry and long for Mrs. Moore.</p>

<p>When Marian had been with the St. Claires
a week, Aunt Amelia told her she could never
hope to hear from Mrs. Moore, partly because
Mrs. Moore didn't know where she lived, and
also because Mrs. Moore would gladly forget
such a bad tempered, ungrateful little girl.</p>

<p>The pink roses under the blue sky were a
comfort then. So were the birds. Day after
day Marian gave them messages to carry to
Mrs. Moore. She talked to them in the orchard
and in the locust grove, and many a
wild bird listened, with its head on one side,
to the loving words of the little girl and then
flew straight away over the tree-tops and the
house-tops, away and away out of sight. Several
weeks passed before Marian knew that she
might pick dandelions and clover blossoms,
Bouncing Bet and all the roadside blooms, to
her heart's content. That was joy!</p>

<p>Under a wide-spreading apple-tree, Marian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
made a collection of treasures she found in
the yard. Curious stones were chief among
them. Bits of moss, pretty twigs, bright
leaves, broken china, colored glass&mdash;there was
no end to the resources of that yard. One
morning she found a fragile cup of blue. It
looked like a tiny bit of painted egg shell, but
how could an egg be so small, and who could
have painted it? She carried the wonder to
Uncle George who told her it was part of a
robin's egg.</p>

<p>"Who ate it?" asked Marian, whereupon
Uncle George explained to her what the
merest babies knew in the world outside the
city. More than that, he went to the orchard,
found a robin's nest on the low branch of an
apple-tree, and lifted her on his shoulder so
that she might see it. There were four blue
eggs in the nest. Marian wanted to break
them to see the baby birds inside, but Uncle
George cautioned her to wait and let the
mother bird take care of her own round
cradle.</p>

<p>In the meantime Madam Robin scolded
Uncle George and Marian until they left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
tree to watch her from a distance. That
robin's nest filled Marian's every thought for
days and days. When the baby birds were
hatched she was so anxious to see them oftener
than Uncle George had time to lift her on his
shoulder, she learned to climb the tree. After
that Marian was oftener in the apple-trees than
under them. Had there been no rainy days
and had the summer lasted all the year, Marian
would have been a fortunate child. Aunt
Amelia called her a tomboy and said no one
would ever catch Ella St. Claire climbing trees
and running like a wild child across the yard
and through the locust grove.</p>

<p>The two children admired each other. Had
it been possible they would have played together
all the time. Marian, who became a
sun-browned romp, thought there never was
such a dainty creature as her delicate, white-skinned
cousin Ella, whose long black curls
were never tumbled by the wind or play: and
Ella never missed a chance to talk with her
laughing, joyous cousin, who could always
think of something new.</p>

<p>Aunt Amelia said that Ella wasn't the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
child when she was left with Marian for half
an hour, and she could not allow the children
to play together for her little daughter's sake.
It was her duty as a mother to guard that little
daughter from harmful influences.</p>

<p>This was the talk to which Marian listened
day after day. It grieved her to the quick.
Again and again, especially on rainy days, she
promised Aunt Amelia that she would be
good, and each time Aunt Amelia sent her to
her room to think over the bad things she had
done and what an ungrateful child she was.
Although Marian became convinced that she
was a bad child, she couldn't sit down and
think of her sins long at a time, and her penitent
spells usually ended in a concert. Uncle
George took her to one early in the summer,
and ever after, playing concert was one of
Marian's favorite games. She had committed
"Bingen on the Rhine" to memory from
hearing it often read in school at the Home,
and on rainy days when sent to her room, she
chanted it, wailed it and recited it until poor
Ella was unhappy and discontented because
she could have no part in the fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Ella had a toy piano kept as an ornament.
Marian's piano was a chair, her stool was a
box and her sheet music, an almanac: but in
her soul was joy.</p>

<p>"What can you do with such a child?" demanded
Aunt Amelia.</p>

<p>"Let her alone," counseled Uncle George.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="c">THAT YELLOW CUCUMBER</p>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> summer day the St. Claires were the
guests of a farmer who lived a few miles from
town. Ella stayed in the house with her
mother and the farmer's wife, but Marian
saw the farm; the cows and the sheep and the
fields of grain. She asked more questions that
day than the hired man ever answered at one
time in his life before, and when night came
he and Marian were tired.</p>

<p>"She knows as much about farming as I
do," the man said with a laugh as he put the
sleepy child on the back seat of the carriage
when the family were ready to go home.</p>

<p>"I've had a lovely time, Mr. Hired Man,"
Marian roused herself to remark, "and to-morrow
I'm going to play farm."</p>

<p>"Good haying weather," the man suggested
with a smile; "better get your barns up quick's
you can."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to," was the response; "it's a
lovely game."</p>

<p>Whatever Marian saw or heard that pleased
her fancy, she played. Stories that were read
to the little Ella were enacted again and again
in Marian's room if the day was rainy, out in
the orchard or the locust grove if the day was
fair. Farming promised to be the most interesting
game of all.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Marian visited
what she called the yarrow jungle ever since
Uncle George read jungle stories to Ella.
More than one queer looking creature tried to
keep out of sight when her footsteps were
heard. The old black beetle scampered away
as fast as his six legs would carry him, though
it can't be possible he remembered the time
when Marian captured him for her museum.
Crickets gathered up their fiddles, seeking
safety beyond the fence. Perhaps they
thought Marian wanted them to play in the
orchestra at another snail wedding. Even
the ants hastened to the hills beyond the
jungle, leaving only the old toad to wink and
blink at the happy one of whom he had no fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Toad," said she, "why don't
you hop along? I've come to make my farm
out here where the yarrow grows. Why don't
you live in the garden land? I would if I
were you. Don't you know about the cool
tomato groves and the cabbage tents? I've
got to clear away this jungle so the sun may
shine upon my farm the way the country
man said. You really must go, so hop along
and stop winking and blinking at me." The
old toad wouldn't stir, so for his sake Marian
spared the yarrow jungle.</p>

<p>"After all, I'll make my farm here on the
border-land," said she, while the daisies
nodded and the buttercups shone brighter
than before. "Only, I'll tell you one thing,
Mr. Toad, that maybe you won't like. If you
will stay there, you'll have to be an elephant
in the jungle. There, now, I s'pose you are
sorry. I say&mdash;be an elephant and now you
are one." The toad didn't mind a bit. He
was so used to being changed into all sorts of
animals that he never seemed to notice whether
he was an elephant or a kangaroo.</p>

<p>Day after day Marian worked upon her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
farm, enclosing fields and meadows with high
stone walls, clearing roads and planting trees.
Whatever she touched became what she wished
it to be. Pasteboard match-boxes became
houses and barns. Sticks became men working
upon the farm and spools were wagons
bearing loads of hay from place to place. At
a word from her, green apples, standing upon
four twigs, were instantly changed, becoming
pigs, cows, sheep and horses. Kernels of
yellow corn were chickens. It was a wonderful
farm and for many a sunny hour Marian
was happy. Even the old toad, winking and
blinking beneath the shadow of the yarrow
jungle, must have known it.</p>

<p>At last there came a morning when the
child went strolling through the garden.
Suddenly, while singing her usual merry
song, the joyous look faded from her face.
She no longer saw the butterflies floating
about nor cared that the bumble-bee wore his
best velvet coat. There were tiny green
cucumbers in that garden, just the right size
for horses on the little girl's farm. There were
a great many cucumbers, so many that Marian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
felt sure no one would ever miss a few. She
picked a handful and knew that she was
stealing. The sun went under a cloud. A
blue jay mocked at her and a wren scolded.
Though far from happy, Marian hurried
away to her farm. The old toad saw her
sticking twigs in the cucumbers. Then she
placed them in a row.</p>

<p>"Now be animals!" she commanded, but
the spell was broken&mdash;she was no longer a
farmer with magic power, but a pink-faced
little girl who had done what she knew was
wrong. And the cucumbers refused to be
anything but cucumbers.</p>

<p>Again the little girl went to the garden, returning
with one big yellow cucumber that
had gone to seed. "Now I guess I'll have a
cucumber animal," she said, in tones so cross
the daisies seemed to tremble. "You bad old
cucumber, you're no good anyway, nobody
could eat you, nor make a pickle of you, so
you may just turn yourself into a giant cow
right off this minute! There you are, standing
on four sticks. Now be a cow, I say."</p>

<p>The old cucumber wouldn't be a cow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
There it stood, big and yellow, spoiling the
looks of the farm.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, old toad?"
went on the little girl. "I tell you that's a
cow, and if you don't believe it you can just
get off my farm quick's you can hop. You're
homely anyway, and you turned yourself back
into a toad when I said be an elephant."</p>

<p>How surprised the toad was when the little
girl took a stick and poked him along ahead
of her. The poor old fellow had never been
treated like that in his life. When he reached
the garden he hid beneath the nearest cabbage
plant. The little girl went on but came back
in a short time with her apron full of cucumbers.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll sit down here and put the
sticks in them," she said: but instead of
touching the cucumbers the child sat on the
ground beside the toad forever so long, looking
cross, oh, so cross. The toad kept perfectly
still and by and by he and the little
girl heard a man whistling. In a few minutes
there was a long whistle and then no sound in
the jungle save the buzzing of flies and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
chirping of birds. The little girl was afraid
of her uncle who had been her one friend in
that land of strangers. Soon she heard them
calling and with her apron full of cucumbers,
Marian rose to meet him.</p>

<p>It may be that the old toad, as he hopped
back to the yarrow jungle, thought that he
should never again see the little girl: but the
next morning in the midst of brightest sunshine,
Marian returned, her head drooping.
With her little feet she destroyed the farm
and then, throwing herself face downward
among the ruins, wept bitterly. When she
raised her head the old toad was staring solemnly
at her, causing fresh tears to overflow
upon the round cheeks.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me, toad, nobody does," she
wailed. "I'm dreadfully bad and it doesn't
do a bit of good to be sorry. Nobody loves
me and nobody ever will. Aunt Amelia says
that Nanna wouldn't love me now. Uncle
George doesn't love me, he says he's disappointed
in me! Oh, dear, oh, dear! Nobody
in this world loves me, toad, and oh,
dear, I've got to eat all alone in the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
for two weeks, and even the housemaid doesn't
love me and can't talk to me! Oh, dear,
what made me do it!"</p>

<p>What could an old toad do but hide in the
yarrow jungle: yet when he turned away
Marian felt utterly deserted. It was dreadful
to be so bad that even a toad wouldn't look
at her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="c">AN UNDESERVING CHILD</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Try</span> as hard as she would, Marian could
not fit into Aunt Amelia's home. Everywhere
within its walls, she was Marian the
unwanted. Saddest of all, the child annoyed
Uncle George. Not at first, to be sure; he
liked his little niece in the beginning, but
when Aunt Amelia and the little Ella were
rendered unhappy by her presence, that made
a difference.</p>

<p>Early in the summer Uncle George insisted
upon taking Marian wherever Ella and her
mother went, to picnics, to the circus and
other places of amusement, but as something
disagreeable was sure to happen and trouble
seemed to follow little Marian, she was finally
left at home where her gay talk and merriment
could not reach the ears of Aunt Amelia,
who called her talk "clatter" and her laughter
"cackle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's cucumbers," sobbed Marian, the first
time she was left with the sympathetic housemaid.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you poor little
thing?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>The child looked up in astonishment.
"Don't you remember about the cucumbers?"
she asked reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Cucumbers," sniffed the girl. "Never
mind, you poor, sweet darling, we'll have a
tea-party this afternoon, you and I,&mdash;that old
pelican!"</p>

<p>Marian knew no better than to tell about the
tea-party, what a jolly time she had and how
happy she was, closing her story by asking
Uncle George if a pelican was a chicken.</p>

<p>"Because," she added, "we had a little dish
of cream chicken and I didn't see any pelican,
but Annie did say two or three times, 'that
old pelican!'"</p>

<p>Aunt Amelia was prejudiced against pelicans
and she objected to tea-parties, so Annie
packed her trunk and left. Lala took her
place. Lala was equally kind but far too wise.
She befriended the little girl every way in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
her power but cautioned her to keep her
mouth shut. She went so far as to instruct
the child in the art of lying and had there
not been deep in Marian's nature a love of
truth, Lala's influence might have been more
effective. Marian turned from her without
knowing why, nor would she accept any
favors from the girl unless she believed Aunt
Amelia approved.</p>

<p>Lala called Marian a "Little fool," Aunt
Amelia called her an undeserving, ungrateful
child who would steal if she were not watched,
a saucy, bold "young one" who had disappointed
her Uncle George, and Uncle George
plainly didn't love her. What wonder that
Marian had a small opinion of herself and
dreaded the first Monday in September, the
beginning of her school-days among strangers.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse was so far from where
Aunt Amelia lived, Marian carried her
luncheon in a tin pail. The child left
home that Monday, a timid, shrinking
little mortal, afraid to speak to any one.
She returned, happy as a lark, swinging her
dinner pail and singing a new song until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
within sight of the St. Claire home. Then
she walked more slowly and entered the gate
like a weary pilgrim. She expected trouble,
poor little Marian, but there happened to be
callers, giving her a chance to escape unnoticed
to the locust grove where she made a
jumping rope of a wild grape vine and played
until the shadows were long and the day was
done.</p>

<p>That evening Uncle George questioned Marian
about her teacher and how she liked
school. "I hope," said he, when he had
listened to the account so gladly given, "I
hope you will be a credit to your uncle and
that you will behave yourself and get to the
head of your class and stay there. Don't give
your Uncle George any cause to be ashamed
of his niece. I want to be proud of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you!" exclaimed the child. "Oh,
I'll try so hard to be good and learn my lessons
best of anybody. Then will you love
me?"</p>

<p>"Good children are always loved," put in
Aunt Amelia. "Doesn't your Uncle George
love Ella?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's his little girl," ventured Marian,
longing for a place beside Ella in her uncle's
lap. He certainly did love Ella.</p>

<p>"Sit down, child," said Uncle George,
"you're my brother's little girl, aren't you,
and you are Ella's cousin, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I am sure she ought to be grateful," interrupted
Aunt Amelia, "with all she has done
for her and such a home provided for
her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am, I am," protested Marian earnestly.
"I'm so glad I've got a home I don't
know what to do, and I'm gratefuller'n anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Queer way of showing your gratitude," exclaimed
Aunt Amelia; "a more undeserving
child I never saw."</p>

<p>Uncle George bit his lip. "Now don't cry,
Marian," he cautioned, as the child's eyes
filled with tears. "I have a story to read
you and Ella, so sit down and be quiet."</p>

<p>"Don't expect her to be quiet," Aunt
Amelia persisted. "If she would listen to
stories as Ella does, I wouldn't send her to
bed. You know as well as I do that she in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>terrupts
and asks questions and gets in a perfect
fever of excitement. Ella behaves like a
lady. You never catch her squirming and
fidgeting about, acting like a perfect jumping-jack&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," remarked Uncle George, opening
the book in his hand, "she goes to sleep.
Don't you, pet?"</p>

<p>"Go to bed, Marian," Aunt Amelia commanded.
"Not a word. I shall not allow you
to add sauciness to disobedience. Go!"</p>

<p>Uncle George frowned, put away the book
and reached for his newspaper: then, touched
by the pathetic figure in the doorway he
called the child back. "That's right," he
said, "be a good girl and obey your aunt
promptly. She has your interest at heart,
child. Come, kiss Uncle George good-night."</p>

<p>Marian was surprised because her natural
tendency to kiss every one in the family before
going to bed had been severely checked
and she had been obliged to whisper her good-nights
to the cat. If she sometimes kissed
its soft fur, what difference did it make, if
the cat had no objection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now kiss little cousin Ella," suggested
Uncle George, but Ella covered her face, saying
her mother had told her never to let Marian
touch her.</p>

<p>Uncle George looked so angry Marian didn't
know what was going to happen. He put
little Ella in her mother's lap and then taking
Marian in his arms, carried her to her
room. After the child had said her prayers
and was in bed, Uncle George sat beside her
and talked a long, long while. He told her
to try and be a good child and do her best in
school.</p>

<p>Marian dreamed that night of Mrs. Moore
and the little stranger's mother. When she
awoke in the starlight she was not afraid as
usual. She thought of Uncle George and
how she would try to please him in school
that he might be proud of her and love her as
she loved him, and so fell peacefully asleep.</p>

<p>When the man was looking over his papers
the next morning before breakfast he felt a
touch upon his arm. He smiled when he saw
Marian. "I want to tell you," she said, "I'm
awful sorry about the cucumbers."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="c">IN THE NAME OF SANTA CLAUS</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> November Ella and her mother began
making plans for Christmas. Aunt Amelia
invited seven little girls to tea one night
when Uncle George was away, and Marian ate
in the kitchen with Lala. The seven were
all older than Ella and one of them, little
Ruth Higgins, knowing no better, asked for
Marian. Lala overheard the answer and was
indignant.</p>

<p>"You poor little lamb," she sputtered, upon
returning to the kitchen, "I'd run away if I
were you."</p>

<p>"Where would I run to?" questioned Marian.</p>

<p>"Anywhere'd be better than here," the
girl replied, "and that woman calls herself a
Christian!"</p>

<p>"She's a awful cross Christian," Marian admitted
in a whisper, brushing away the tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
that came when she heard the peals of laughter
from the dining-room.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't cry if I were you," advised the
girl. "You'll only spoil your pretty eyes and
it will do them good to see you cry, you poor
baby. The idea of having a party and making
you stay out here!"</p>

<p>"It's a Club," corrected Marian, "I've heard
'em talking about it. Dorothy Avery and Ruth
Higgins belong. I've tried so hard to be good
so I could be in it. They are going to sew
presents for poor children and give them toys
and everything they don't want their own
selves, and then when Christmas day comes
they're going to have a sleigh ride and take
the things to the poor children. If I was
good like Ella, I could be in it. I used to be
good, Lala, truly, I did."</p>

<p>"There, there, don't cry," begged Lala.
"Look a-here! did you ever see anybody
dance the lame man's jig?"</p>

<p>Marian shook her head, whereupon Lala
performed the act to the music of a mournful
tune she hummed, while Marian laughed
until the Club was forgotten. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
plenty of fun in the kitchen after that. In
the midst of the hilarity Ella appeared to tell
Marian it was her bedtime.</p>

<p>"Are you ever afraid, Lala, when you wake
up all alone in the night?" asked Marian as
she started up the back stairs.</p>

<p>"I never wake up," said Lala. "Do you,
Marian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm lonesome without all the
little girls. Sometimes I'm so frightened I
pretty nearly die when I'm all alone and it's
dark."</p>

<p>"Little girls," echoed Lala, "what little
girls? Where did you live before you came
here?"</p>

<p>"When I was good I lived in a big city,
Lala."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," the girl insisted.</p>

<p>"If you'll promise you won't ever tell, I
will," declared Marian. "I'll have to whisper
it. I lived in a beautiful orphan's home,
Lala."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Lala. "Oh, you poor
baby."</p>

<p>"Of course it's dreadful," Marian hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
to say, "but I couldn't help it, Lala, truly I
couldn't; they took me there when I was a
baby and it was a lovely place, only, it was a
Home."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about your father
and mother?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess they're dead&mdash;my mother is
anyway, and I'm 'fraid about my father."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, Lala, Aunt Amelia always says,
what can you expect when you think what
my father was. I guess may be he was a
stealer because Aunt Amelia won't stop talking
about the cucumbers and what could you
expect. Maybe he is in prison."</p>

<p>"No, your father is not in prison, Marion
Lee!" Lala exclaimed. "Listen. It was your
father I heard them talking about with some
callers the other day. I'm sure of it now, because
they said the man was a great deal
younger than your uncle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me, do tell me what you know
about my father?" besought Marian, walking
back into the kitchen on tiptoes.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know much," said the girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
"but he isn't in prison, that's one sure thing.
He went away to South America years ago to
make his fortune, and they know that all the
men who went with him were killed, and as
your father never came back they know he
must be dead."</p>

<p>"What was there bad about that?" questioned
the small daughter.</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the reply, "only he and
your Uncle George had a quarrel. Your
uncle didn't want him to go because he said
your father had plenty of money anyway, and
it all came out as he said it would."</p>

<p>At that moment, Ella returned. Seeing
Marian, she forgot that she was after a drink
of water. "Oh, Marian Lee!" she exclaimed.
"I'm going straight back and tell mamma you
didn't go to bed when I told you to. You'll
be sorry."</p>

<p>Marian, the guilty, flew up the back stairs,
expecting swift punishment. She was sure
she deserved it, and what would Uncle George
say? It was so hard to be good. Retribution
was left to Santa Claus. How could a disobedient,
ungrateful child expect to be re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>membered
by that friend of good children?
How could Marian hope for a single gift?
Aunt Amelia didn't know. Nevertheless the
little girl pinned her faith to Santa Claus.
He had never forgotten her nor the two hundred
waifs at the Home. Teddy Daniels once
made a face at the superintendent the very
day before Christmas, yet Santa Claus gave
him a drum.</p>

<p>Marian wasn't the least surprised Christmas
morning when she found her stockings hanging
by the sitting-room grate filled to the
brim, exactly as Ella's were. She was delighted
beyond expression.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" she cried. "Both my
stockings are full of things for me. Oh, see
the packages! Oh, I am so happy! Just
only look at the presents!" Uncle George
left the room and Marian sat upon the rug to
examine her treasures.</p>

<p>"Why don't you look in your stockings,
Ella?" she suggested. "Let's undo our presents
together."</p>

<p>"No, I'd rather wait and see what you'll
say when you know what you've got!" Ella<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
replied. "Mamma and I know something."</p>

<p>"Hush!" cautioned Aunt Amelia. "Let's
see what Santa Claus has brought Marian.
She knows whether she's been a deserving,
grateful child or not."</p>

<p>Why would Aunt Amelia remind one of
disagreeable things on Christmas morning?
Marian's chin quivered before she took a
thing from her stocking, whereupon Aunt
Amelia smiled. In the meantime, Ella, becoming
impatient, emptied one of her stockings
in her mother's lap and began a series
of squeals as toys, games and dolls tumbled out.</p>

<p>"Oh, what fun!" cried Marian, laughing
and clapping her hands as she witnessed
Ella's delight. A pitiful expression stole
over her face as she turned to her own stockings.
How she longed for a mother to share
her joy. How she wished Aunt Amelia would
smile kindly and be pleased with her gifts.
The child quickly removed the paper from a
round package.</p>

<p>"I've got a ball," she ventured. "I'll let
you play with it, Ella."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Got one of my own," said Ella, exhibiting
a big rubber ball.</p>

<p>An exclamation of dismay burst from
Marian's lips. "Why, why&mdash;it's a potato!"
she cried.</p>

<p>"What did you expect?" inquired Aunt
Amelia in chilling tones.</p>

<p>"I guess that was just for a joke." The
little girl smiled cheerfully as she said it, at the
same time untying a box wrapped in tissue
paper. Potatoes again. Marian shut her lips
tight together and tried another package.
More potatoes. Still she kept the tears back
and reached for a long bundle. Removing
the paper she found switches. Aunt Amelia
and Ella watched silently as Marian, her eyes
blazing and her cheeks growing a deeper red
every second, emptied the stocking in which
there was nothing but potatoes. Then the
child rose, straightened her small figure to its
full height and made this statement:</p>

<p>"That wasn't never Santa Claus that did
that!"</p>

<p>"Look in the other stocking," Ella advised,
"there are real presents in that one. I guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
you will be a good girl now, won't you,
Marian? Take the other stocking down,
quick."</p>

<p>"No," declared Marian, "I don't want any
more potatoes. Nobody loves me and I don't
care if they don't." Then she broke down
and cried so hard, Ella cried too.</p>

<p>"What's all the trouble?" asked Uncle
George, entering the room at that moment.</p>

<p>"Marian is making a scene and distressing
both Ella and me," explained Aunt Amelia.
"She has been highly impertinent and ungrateful.
Ella, you may have the other
stocking yourself."</p>

<p>"But I don't want it," sobbed Ella. "I
want Marian to have it."</p>

<p>"Then we'll take it to the poor children
this afternoon," said her mother. "They'll
be glad to get it. Marian, don't drop what's
in your apron. Now go to your room and
think over how you've spoiled the peace of a
family on Christmas morning. I'll bring
your breakfast to you myself."</p>

<p>"I don't want any breakfast," sobbed Marian,
walking away with her apron full of potatoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come back," called Uncle George. "You
tell your aunt you are sorry you were so
naughty, and you may come to breakfast with
us. It's Christmas morning, child, why can't
you behave?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't naughty," sobbed Marian.
"I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not another word," put in Aunt Amelia.
"Go to your room, stubborn, bad child. I
can't have such an example continually before
my little Ella. We'll have to put her in
a reform school, George, if she doesn't improve."</p>

<p>This remark fell upon unheeding ears so
far as Marian was concerned. The minute
the door of her little room closed behind her
she dropped the potatoes upon the floor and
throwing herself beside them cried as if her
heart would break.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nanna, Nanna, I want you," she
sobbed. "Oh, where are you, oh, my Mrs.
Moore?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="c">AT THE RICH MAN'S TABLE</p>


<p><span class="smcap">True</span> to her word, Aunt Amelia carried
Marian's breakfast to her room. But for the
interference of Uncle George his little niece
would have been given bread and water; it
was all an impertinent child deserved. Uncle
George, however, insisted that the One who
was born on Christmas Day was a friend to
sinners great and small. Out of respect to His
memory, Marian should have her breakfast.
Lala offered to take the tray up-stairs when it
was ready, but Aunt Amelia said it was her
duty to take it herself: so there was no one to
speak a word of comfort to the little black
sheep outside the fold.</p>

<p>It had been a dark, cloudy morning, but
curiously enough, the moment the door closed
behind Aunt Amelia, the sun came out bright
and warm, and shone straight through Marian's
window. The child raised her head, wiped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
her eyes and finally sat up. She wouldn't eat
any breakfast of course, how could she? No
one loved her and what was the use of eating?
The tray looked tempting though and the
breakfast smelled good. The big orange
seemed rolling toward her and Uncle George
must have poured the cream on her oatmeal.
No one else would have given her so much.
The omelet was steaming, and even Lala never
made finer looking rolls.</p>

<p>Marian moved a little nearer and a little
nearer to the tray until the next thing she
knew she was sitting in a chair, eating breakfast.
Everything tasted good, and in a little
while Marian felt better. Out of doors, the
icy trees sparkled in the sunshine and all the
world looked clean and new. Oh, how the
little girl longed for a mother that Christmas
morning. Some one who would love her and
say "Dear little Marian," as Nanna once did.</p>

<p>Thinking of Mrs. Moore brought back to
the child's memory that last day in the Home.
Mrs. Moore had said, "Be brave, be good and
never forget the Father in heaven." Marian
had not been brave nor good; and she had for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>gotten
the Father in heaven. Suddenly the
child looked around the room, under the bed
everywhere. She was certainly alone. It
seemed strange to say one's prayers in the daytime,
but Marian folded her hands and kneeling
in the flood of sunshine beneath the window,
confessed her sins. She felt like a new
born soul after that. The despairing, rebellious
little Marian was gone, and in her place was a
child at peace with herself and the world.
Without putting it in words, Marian forgave
Aunt Amelia: more than that, she felt positively
tender towards her. She would tell her
she was sorry for her impertinence and promise
to be a good child. It would be so easy to
do right. She would set Ella a good example.
Not for anything would Marian ever again do
what was wrong. In time Uncle George and
Aunt Amelia would love her dearly.</p>

<p>Marian smiled thoughtfully as she gazed
down the straight and perfect path her little
feet would travel from thenceforth forevermore.
The child's meditations were interrupted
by a remembrance of the potatoes.
There they were, her Christmas presents, try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>ing
to hide under the bed, under the chairs,
beneath the bureau. She stared at them but
a moment when a happy smile broke over
her face.</p>

<p>Marian was a saint no longer; only a little
girl about to play a new game.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a circus!" she exclaimed, and
straightway seizing the potatoes and breaking
the switches into little sticks, she transformed
the unwelcome gift into a circus parade. The
elephant came first. His trunk was a trifle
too stiff as the switches were not limber. The
camel came next and if his humps were not
exactly in the right place, he was all the more
of a curiosity. Then followed the giraffe with
sloping back and no head worth mentioning
because there was nothing to stick on the
piece of switch that formed his long neck.
Marian did wish she had a bit of gum to use
for a head. The giraffe would look more
finished. The lion and the tiger were perfect.
Marian could almost hear them roar. Nobody
could have found any fault with the kangaroo
except that he would fall on his front feet.
The hippopotamus was a sight worth going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
see. So was the rhinoceros. The zebras almost
ran away, they were so natural.</p>

<p>Marian searched eagerly for more potatoes.
A peck would have been none too many.
"I'll have to play the rest of the animals are
in cages," she said with a sigh. "Too bad I
didn't get more potatoes. Wish I had the
other stocking."</p>

<p>When Marian was tired of circus, she played
concert. Bingen on the Rhine came in for
its share of attention, but school songs were
just as good and had ready-made tunes.</p>

<p>Lala in the kitchen, heard the operatic
singing and laughed. Aunt Amelia caught a
few strains, frowned and closed the hall doors.
Uncle George smiled behind his newspaper:
but Ella, tired of her toys, pouted and said
she wished she could ever have any fun.
Marian always had a good time. Mrs. St.
Claire reminded her of the sleigh ride with
the seven little girls in the afternoon and
Ella managed to get through the morning
somehow, even if it was dull and Christmas
joy was nowhere in the house except in the
little room off the back hall up-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>At one o'clock Lala was sent to tell Marian
she might come down to dinner if she would
apologize to Aunt Amelia for her impertinence.
Lala was forbidden to say more, but
nobody thought to caution her not to laugh,
and what did Lala do when she saw Marian
playing the piano beside the circus parade, but
laugh until the tears ran down her cheeks.
Worst of all she waited on table with a broad
smile on her face that made Aunt Amelia
quite as uncomfortable as the mention of a
pelican. Nor was it possible for Aunt Amelia
to understand how a child who had been in
disgrace all the forenoon, could be cheerful
and ready to laugh on the slightest provocation.
She thought it poor taste.</p>

<p>After dinner Ella thrust a repentant looking
stocking in Marian's hand. "Papa says
the things are yours and you must have
them," she explained.</p>

<p>"What makes the stocking look so floppy?"
asked Marian.</p>

<p>"Because," Ella went on, "papa made me
take all the potatoes out and there wasn't
much left. You've got a handkerchief in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
stocking from me and one from mamma,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't tell me," protested Marian.
"I want to be s'prised."</p>

<p>"Like the selfish child you are," put in
Aunt Amelia, "unwilling to give your cousin
a bit of pleasure."</p>

<p>"And a box of dominoes from papa and
a doll's tea set Lala gave you," finished
Ella.</p>

<p>"She'll expect a doll next," observed Aunt
Amelia.</p>

<p>"I did think Santa Claus would give me
one," admitted the child, "but I had rather
have the beautiful tea set. Help me set the
table on this chair, Ella, and we'll play Christmas
dinner. I'll let you pour the tea
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ella has no time to play," her mother
interrupted. "Come, little one, help mamma
finish packing the baskets of presents for the
poor children."</p>

<p>"But I had rather play with Marian's tea
set," pouted Ella.</p>

<p>"You have one of your own, dearest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't as nice as Marian's, though, and I
want to stay here and play."</p>

<p>"Now you see, George," and Mrs. St. Claire
turned to her husband, "now you see why I
cannot allow these children to play together.
You can see for yourself what an influence
Marian has over our little Ella. Come, darling,
have you forgotten the sleigh ride? It
is time to get ready."</p>

<p>"Me too?" questioned Marian, springing to
her feet, "shall I get ready?"</p>

<p>The child knew her mistake in less than a
minute, but forgetting the uselessness of protest,
she begged so earnestly to be taken with
the children Aunt Amelia called her saucy,
and as a punishment, the Christmas gifts, tea
set and all, were put on a high shelf out of
sight.</p>

<p>Marian was allowed to stand in the parlor
by the window to see the sleigh-load of noisy
children drive away. When they were gone,
the parlor seemed bigger than usual and
strangely quiet. Uncle George, with a frown
on his face, was reading in the sitting-room.
He didn't look talkative and the clock ticked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
loud. Marian turned again to the parlor
window. Across the street was the rich man's
house, and in the front window of the rich
man's house was a poor little girl looking out&mdash;a
sad little girl with big eyes and a pale
face. Marian waved her hand and the little
girl waved hers&mdash;such a tiny, white hand. A
new idea flashed into Marian's mind. She
had often seen the little girl across the way
and wondered why she never played with
Ella. At last she thought she knew. The
rich man's wife probably went to a hospital
after the little girl, and took her home to get
well just as Janey Clark was taken home,
only Janey was never thin and delicate and
Janey never stared quietly at everything as
the little girl did who lived in the rich man's
house.</p>

<p>Marian wondered why Aunt Amelia didn't
leave her some of the presents in the baskets.
Perhaps nobody loved the little girl: maybe
her father and mother were dead and Santa
Claus didn't know where to find her. Marian
wished she had something to take to the poor
thing. She would have given away her tea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
set that minute had it been within reach.
Just then a long-legged horse went by, a horse
that looked so queer it reminded Marian of
her potato menagerie. The child smiled at
the thought. Perhaps the little girl in the
rich man's house never saw a potato animal
and would like to see one. Perhaps she
would like two or three for a Christmas present.
Why not? It was all Marian had to
give and the animals were funny enough to
make any poor little girl laugh. Up-stairs
Marian flew, returning with the elephant, the
rhinoceros, the hippopotamus and two zebras
packed in a pasteboard box.</p>

<p>"Please, Uncle George," she asked, "may I
go and visit the poor little girl that lives in
the rich man's house? I want to say 'Wish
you a merry Christmas' to her, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Run along, child," interrupted Uncle
George, the frown smoothing out as he spoke,
"go where you will and have a good time if
it is possible&mdash;bless your sunny face."</p>

<p>Uncle George had heard of the rich man's
house and he smiled a broad smile of amusement
as he watched Marian climb the steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and ring the bell. "What next?" he inquired
as the door closed behind the child.
In a short time he knew "What next." One
of the rich man's servants came over with a
note from the neighbor's wife, begging Uncle
George to allow Marian to stay and help them
enjoy their Christmas dinner at six. The permission
was gladly given and at eight o'clock
Marian came home hugging an immense wax
doll and fairly bubbling over with excitement.</p>

<p>"I never had such a good time at the table
in my life," she began, "as I did at the rich
man's house. They asked me to talk, just
think of it&mdash;asked me to, and I did and they
did and we all laughed. And the poor little
girl isn't poor, only just sick and she belongs
to the folks. The rich man is her father and
her name is Dolly Russel and she was gladder
to see me than she ever was to see anybody in
her life and she wants me to come again,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I suppose you told all you knew,"
snapped Aunt Amelia.</p>

<p>"Yes, most, 'specially at the table," admitted
the child.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="c">A GAME OF SLICED BIRDS</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Marian</span> was so happy with her doll and
teaset the following day she was blind and
deaf to all that happened in the house outside
her little room. She didn't know that
Mrs. Russel made her first call upon Aunt
Amelia in the afternoon, nor that company
was expected in the evening. Ella's mysterious
airs were lost upon her. The child was
accordingly surprised when she met the company
at breakfast.</p>

<p>Aunt Hester, Mrs. St. Claire's younger
sister, was a pleasant surprise because she
was good-looking and agreeable. She returned
Marian's smile of greeting with interest.
Marian hoped she had found a friend
and hovered near the welcome stranger until
sent to her room. During the rest of the week
she and Aunt Hester exchanged smiles when
they met at the table, and to win a few kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
words from her became Marian's dream. New
Year's Day brought an opportunity. Mrs.
Russel sent a box of sliced birds to Marian
and her cousin, and as the gift came while
the family were at breakfast, Marian knew all
about it. At last she and Ella owned something
in common and might perhaps be allowed
to play together. She could hardly
wait to finish her breakfast.</p>

<p>"What are sliced birds and how do you
play with them?" she asked Aunt Hester,
who carried the box into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Well," began Aunt Hester, "can you read,
Marian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, auntie, I can read pretty near anything
I try to, but I can't write very good,
not a bit good. Do you have to write in
sliced birds?"</p>

<p>"No," was the laughing reply, "if you can
spell a little that is all that is necessary.
Here is a paper with a list of birds on it we
can put together. Now here is the word jay.
A picture of a jay is cut in three pieces, on
one piece is 'J,' on another is 'A' and on the
third is 'Y.' Now hunt for 'J.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ella knows her letters," Marian suggested.
"Come, Ella, hunt for 'J,' that piece would
have a blue jay's head on it, I guess." Marian
waited until Ella found the letter and together
they finished the blue jay. Both children
were delighted with the result.</p>

<p>"Oh, what fun!" cried Marian. "We'll
make all the birds, Ella. I'll read a name
and tell you what letters to hunt for."</p>

<p>A shadow fell across the bright scene, caused
by the entrance of Aunt Amelia. "Go over
there and sit down," she said to Marian. "I
came in to help Hester divide the game."</p>

<p>"Divide the game!" echoed both children.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't do it, please don't," besought
Marian, "we want to play with all the birds
together."</p>

<p>"It seems a pity," began Aunt Hester, but
she gathered Ella in her arms and helped
form all the birds in two straight lines upon
the floor as her sister desired.</p>

<p>Marian watched with eager interest. She
hoped when the birds were divided a few of
the pretty ones might be given to her. If
she had her choice she couldn't tell whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
she would take the peacock or the bird of
paradise&mdash;they were both gorgeous. The
scarlet tanager and the red-headed woodpecker
were beautiful but of course it wasn't
fair to wish for all the brightest birds. It
was Aunt Hester who suggested a way to
divide the game.</p>

<p>"Let them take turns choosing," she said.
"It seems to me that will be perfectly fair.
The children might draw cuts for first
choice."</p>

<p>At that, Marian saw her opportunity.
"Ella may be the first chooser," she declared,
and was rewarded by a smile from
Aunt Hester. Which would Ella take? the
bird of paradise or the peacock? Either
would please Marian, so it really made no
difference which was left. Ella wanted them
both and said so.</p>

<p>"Hush," whispered her mother, "if you
keep still Marian won't know which birds
are the prettiest. Aunt Hester and I will
help you choose."</p>

<p>"I guess I'll take that," Ella decided, pointing
towards the bird of paradise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Marian was about to choose the peacock
when a whispered word from Aunt Hester
caught her ear.</p>

<p>"I hope, Ella dear, that she won't take the
peacock."</p>

<p>Marian hesitated a moment. She wanted
the peacock with its gay, spreading tail, but
if Aunt Hester wished Ella to have it perhaps
she would love whoever helped her get it.
"I'll take the turkey," said the child, whereupon
Ella gave a shout.</p>

<p>"She don't know much, she took an old
brown turkey. I'll have the peacock and I
want the red bird and the redhead."</p>

<p>Aunt Amelia laughed. "One at a time,
you dear, impulsive child," said she, but
Aunt Hester smiled across at Marian. "Your
turn," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll take the owl," Marian quietly replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! an old owl!" laughed Ella, clapping
her hands for joy. "Now I'll have the
redhead! goody! And next time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush," warned her mother. "You
mustn't let Marian know what you want or
she'll take it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"I choose the wren," came in low tones
from Marian.</p>

<p>"My turn," Ella called. "Give me the
redhead."</p>

<p>"Choose the flicker next," advised her
mother, so Marian, still hoping to be loved,
chose the robin.</p>

<p>Aunt Hester smiled again, but the smile
was for Ella. "Take the parrot next," she
whispered, so Marian chose the crow.</p>

<p>"Now, Ella, darling," whispered her mother,
"the oriole, after Marian has her turn," and
Marian, taking the hint, motioned for the jay.</p>

<p>It was over at last and Marian was told to
go to her room. As she was leaving, Aunt
Hester gave Ella a rapturous hug and said,
"Our baby has all the prettiest birds." Aunt
Hester didn't know Marian heard the remark
until she saw the tears that could not be kept
back, wetting the rosy cheeks. "Oh, you
poor young one!" she exclaimed, and but for
the presence of Aunt Amelia, she would have
taken the sad little mortal in her arms.</p>

<p>"She's crying 'cause her birds are all
homely," said Ella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, she always wants the best,"
remarked Mrs. St. Claire, but Aunt Hester
and Ella both gazed after the retreating figure
of little Marian, with conscience-stricken faces.
They had been three against one, and that one
didn't know enough to take the choicest birds
when she had the chance. They hadn't played
fair.</p>

<p>Marian, blinded by tears, stumbled over a
rug at the door of her room and the sliced
birds slipped almost unheeded from her apron.
The nearest seat was the box she called her
piano stool. She dropped upon it and buried
her face in her arms on the piano. The
sheet music tumbled forward upon her head,
perhaps fearing it might be but an old almanac
forever after. Bitter thoughts filled the little
soul. Why would no one love her? Why did
the sound of her voice annoy every one so
she feared to speak? What was the trouble?
Was she so bad or so homely that no one
might love her? She had tried to be good
and tried to do right, but what difference had
it made? Aunt Hester thought her stupid
because she allowed Ella to take what birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
she would. Surely Aunt Hester was the stupid
one.</p>

<p>It was impossible for Marian to feel miserable
long at a time. In a few minutes she sat
up and straightened her sheet music, whereupon
the almanac became a hymn-book. She
turned the leaves slowly as did the young lady
who played the organ prayer-meeting nights.
Then, addressing the wax doll and the bed
posts she announced in solemn tones, "We'll
sing nineteen verses of number 'leventy 'leven."</p>

<p>"Number 'leventy 'leven" happened to be
"Come Ye Disconsolate," a hymn Marian
was familiar with, as it was Aunt Amelia's
favorite. The tune began dismally enough,
but the disconsolate one took courage on the
third line and sang out triumphantly at last,
with a great flourish upon the piano, "'Earth
has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal.'"
"Twenty Froggies Went to School" came
next, and Marian was herself once more,
which is to say, she became at a moment's
notice, a famous musician, a school-teacher, a
princess, a queen or whatever the occasion
required, while the little room was easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
changed into anything from the Desert of
Sahara to a palace.</p>

<p>The extent of Marian's knowledge was the
only limit to the games she played. Pictures
in the family Bible had given her many an
hour of entertainment in the little room,
thanks to the fact that Uncle George allowed
Marian to look at the pictures on an occasional
Sunday afternoon. The doll almost broke her
nose the day before playing "Rebecca at the
Well." The "Marriage at Cana" was a safer
game for a wax doll that could not stand,
especially as the doll made a beautiful bride.
Turning from her piano, Marian saw something
that made her laugh. The robin's head
and the duck's feet had fallen one above the
other.</p>

<p>"Poor robin," she said, "I guess you would
rather have your own feet. R-o-b-i-n, I know
how to spell you, and I'll put you on your
own feet and I'll give the duck his own head
so he can quack." When the robin was put
together it looked like an old friend. "You're
nicer than the bird of paradise, after all," declared
Marian, "because I know you so well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
You and I used to be chums because I didn't
have any little girls to play with."</p>

<p>It was something of a puzzle to put all of
the birds together, but when the work was
finished Marian was pleased. "You're all so
nice and common looking," she said. "I
never saw the owl bird, but we used to hear
him in the woods at night, didn't we, blue
jay? He used to go, 'Who&mdash;who&mdash;whoo&mdash;whoo!'
We used to see you, old black crow,
you always said 'Caw&mdash;caw&mdash;caw,' and you
dear little wren, how I would like to hear you
sing once more. Where are you all now?
Somewhere way down South, because our
teacher says so and when the snow is gone,
you'll come flying back.</p>

<p>"Oh, now we'll play something. It is
autumn over here on the rug, the rug's the
orchard, and the leaves are falling and all the
flowers are fading and winter is coming. You
see that sunshiny spot on the floor over there
under the windows, birdies? Well, that is
down South where you are going. I don't
remember who goes first but I guess the little
wren better fly away now, and we'll have lots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of fun." One by one the birds went south,
owl and all, and one by one they flew back to
the orchard in the spring-time, where the wax
doll welcomed them, listened to their songs
and scattered strings about for them to use in
building their nests.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant game and Marian was
called to the dining-room before she thought
of putting the birds away.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I didn't get the best half of
the game after all," she suggested to the wax
doll as she threw it a parting kiss.</p>

<p>Had Marian known that the bird of paradise,
the peacock and the other bright ones
were laid upon a shelf as birds of no consequence
and that Ella had complained all the
forenoon of having nothing to do, she would
have understood why Aunt Hester not only
greeted her with a smile, but said at the same
time, "You dear, happy child."</p>

<p>It was enough that Aunt Hester said it and
smiled, without puzzling for a reason. Surely
Marian had chosen the better half of the game
when such loving tones were meant for her.
It was wonderful.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="c">THE WAY OF THE TRANSGRESSOR</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A year</span> passed away, in which time Marian
was kept more and more outside of the family
and more and more apart from all ordinary
pleasures of childhood, but in spite of everything
she was happy, ever hoping to win the
approval of her aunt and uncle.</p>

<p>Going to school was a never-failing joy because
at noon-times and recess there were
girls and boys to play with, and the long
walks to and from school were always a delight
to a child who was interested in everything
from a blade of grass to the clouds.</p>

<p>Ella attended a private school near home
and was scarcely allowed to speak to Marian.
She had many playmates, but all of them put
together were not half so attractive from her
point of view as the little cousin who played
alone. One winter morning Ella told Marian
behind the dining-room door that her grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>mother
and Uncle Robert were coming to stay
all the spring-time and that Uncle Robert was
a little boy only a few years older than Marian.
Ella was delighted, but Marian wished Uncle
Robert was a girl. She had reason for the
wish before summer.</p>

<p>Marian was prejudiced against boys for as
much as a year after Ella's uncle went away.
He believed it was his privilege to tease little
girls, though in all his life he never had such
a chance to torment any one as he had that
spring. It was useless to play tricks on Ella,
because she ran crying to her mother and that
made trouble for Robert: but Marian could
appeal to no one and teasing her was safe and
interesting. To hold her doll by the hair
while Marian begged and screamed, was daily
amusement until the child learned to leave
the doll in her room. To hide her few books
was another pleasure and to frighten her on
every possible occasion until her eyes seemed
fairly popping out of her head, was a victory.</p>

<p>Marian was glad to have some one to play
with if that some one was a tyrant and often
before her tears were dry, she was ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
forgive Robert for teasing her and to join in
any game he proposed. One day he suggested
something that shocked Marian. He asked
her to steal sugar. He didn't say steal, he
said "Hook," and at first Marian didn't understand.
Robert told her to sneak into the
pantry after Lala was through work in the
afternoon, take a lump of sugar from the
barrel and give it to him. She wouldn't listen
in the beginning, but by dint of persuasion
and threats, Robert succeeded in getting his
lump of sugar: not only one, but many, for
stealing sugar became easier as the days
went by and no one caught the small
culprit.</p>

<p>Robert's ambition was to be a railroad engineer,
and soon after the sugar stealing began,
he made an engine of boxes and barrels in the
locust grove. When it was finished and in
running order, he allowed Marian to be his
fireman. At first the child thought it was
fun, but when she had shoveled air with a
stick for five minutes without stopping, while
Robert rang the bell, blew the whistle and
ran the engine, she threw down her shovel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
"It's my turn to be engineer now," she declared.</p>

<p>"Girls don't know enough to run engines,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"I'm not a girl," protested Marian, "I'm a
fireman."</p>

<p>"Then tend to your job, why don't you?"
was the retort. "I wouldn't ring the bell for
my fireman if I didn't think he was a good
one. Come, coal up, tend to business."</p>

<p>Somewhat flattered, the fireman smiled,
shoveled coal until his arms ached, and then
rebelled. "I say," she declared, "you've got
to let me be engineer now! I won't be fireman
another minute!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you won't?" taunted the engineer.
"We'll see about that! Of course you needn't
shovel coal for me if you don't want to, but you
had better make up your mind pretty quick, because
if you won't be my fireman, I'll go and
tell my sister Amelia that you steal sugar!"</p>

<p>Marian was too stunned for words until
Robert laughed. Then her face grew scarlet,
and her eyes had a look in them the boy had
never seen before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"You dare not tell!" she screamed, leaning
towards Robert, anger and defiance in every
line of her slight figure. "I say you dare
not!"</p>

<p>"I wonder why?" sniffed the boy.</p>

<p>"You know why; you told me to take the
sugar, and I got it for you and I never tasted
a bit of it. You were such an old pig you
wouldn't give me back a crumb&mdash;old rhinoceros&mdash;hippopotamus&mdash;I'd
call you an elephant
too, only elephants are so much nicer'n
you."</p>

<p>Again the boy laughed. "You hooked the
sugar, didn't you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"What if I did, didn't I do it 'cause you
told me to, and didn't you eat it, you old
gorilla?"</p>

<p>"What if I did, Miss Marian Spitfire? I'll
say it's one of your lies, and no one will believe
what you say. You know you can't look
my sister in the face and tell her you didn't
take the sugar, but I can stand up and cross
my heart and hope to die if I ever saw any
sugar, and they'll believe me and they won't
believe you. Now will you shovel coal?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Toot-toot-toot&mdash;chew-chew-chew&mdash;ding-a-ling-a-ling&mdash;engine's
going to start! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"You mean thing, you horrid boy! I hate
you!" sputtered Marian, but she shoveled
coal. In fact the child shoveled coal the rest
of the spring whenever Robert chose to play
engine, until the day his taunts proved too
much and she kicked his engine to pieces,
threatening to "give it to him," if he didn't
keep out of the way.</p>

<p>"Now tell," she screamed from the midst
of the wreck, "tell anything you're a mind
to, I don't care what you do."</p>

<p>Robert walked away whistling "Yankee
Doodle." "I'm tired of playing engine," he
called over his shoulder, "and I'm much
obliged to you for saving me the trouble of
taking it to pieces. I don't wonder nobody
likes you. My sister Amelia knows what
she's talking about when she says you've got
the worst temper ever was! I bet you'll die
in prison&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll die before you get to prison if you
don't get out of my sight," was the retort.</p>

<p>Robert walked away so fast Marian was cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>tain
he was going to tell about the sugar and
she waited, defiantly at first, then tremblingly.
What would become of her? What would
they do? For reasons best known to himself,
Robert didn't mention sugar, and after a few
days of suspense, Marian breathed easier, although
she wasn't thoroughly comfortable until
Robert and his mother were on their way
home.</p>

<p>A few weeks later Aunt Amelia made a jar
of cookies for Ella's birthday party. She
made them herself and put them on a low
shelf in the pantry. Marian asked for a cookie
and was refused. She didn't expect to get it.
The more she thought of the cookies, the more
she wanted one. She remembered the sugar.
No one but Robert knew about that sugar, and
if she helped herself to a cooky that would be
her own secret. Marian took a cooky and ate
it back of the orchard. Her old friends, the
chipping sparrows, flew down for the crumbs
that fell at her feet. The little birds were surprised
when Marian frightened them away.
She had been so kind to them they had lost
all fear of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The second cooky Marian took she ate in
the locust grove where she was much annoyed
by the curiosity of a chipmunk. He asked
her questions with his head on one side and
his hand on his heart. His chatter made her
angry. What was it to him if she happened
to be eating a cooky? She did wish folks
would mind their own business. From that
day, Marian grew reckless. She carried away
cookies two or three at a time and talked back
to the birds and the squirrels and all the inhabitants
of the orchard and the locust grove
who were not polite enough to hide their inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>For once in her life, Marian had all the
cookies she wished, although they agreed with
neither her stomach nor her conscience. She
didn't feel well and she was cross and unhappy.
At last Marian knew that the day
of reckoning was near at hand. She could
almost touch the bottom of the cooky jar
when she realized that the cookies had been
made for Ella's party and had not been used
upon the table. No one had lifted the cover
of the jar but herself since the day they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
baked. It was a frightful thought. There
was no more peace for Marian. Awake or
dreaming, the cookies were ever before her.
In school and at home they haunted her.
What should she do, what could she do?</p>

<p>Quietly the child went about the house.
She no longer sang nor laughed. Uncle
George wondered, Aunt Amelia rejoiced. She
thought Marian's usual high spirits unbecoming
a child dependent upon charity, as Marian
had often heard her remark.</p>

<p>"She may be working too hard in school,"
suggested Uncle George.</p>

<p>"Whatever is the cause she has behaved so
well lately, I shall allow her in the sitting-room
with the children when Ella has her
party," conceded Aunt Amelia.</p>

<p>Even a shadow of kindness touched Marian's
heart. Oh, why had she done wrong? From
the depths of her soul, the child repented.
Why had she been called bad in the days
when she tried to be good, and at last when
she was so bad, why would Aunt Amelia declare
that there was a great improvement in
her behavior, and why would Uncle George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
speak to her almost as pleasantly as he did to
Ella? If only she had remembered the words
of Mrs. Moore before it was too late; to "Be
good and to do right." Mrs. Moore also said,
"Be brave." It would be brave to go to Aunt
Amelia and tell her the truth about the cookies.
Marian had not been good, she had not
done right and she could not be brave.</p>

<p>Many and many a time the child studied
the grim face of Aunt Amelia, repeating over
and over to herself "Be brave." It seemed
to Marian that if she attempted telling Aunt
Amelia of her sin, she would die on the spot,
choke to death, perhaps, trying to get the
words out. Her throat closed tight together
at the very thought. It might, under some
circumstances, be possible to tell Uncle George,
although to confess was to be forever an outcast.
Neither Uncle George nor Aunt Amelia
would ever love her, nor would she ever be
allowed to play with Ella. All the golden
texts Marian had ever learned, haunted her
memory. "The way of the transgressor is
hard." "Be sure your sin will find you out."
"Enter not into the path of the wicked."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
"Evil pursueth sinners." There were many
others, so many, the child was sorry she had
ever gone to Sunday-school.</p>

<p>The day of the party was bright and beautiful.
All the little girls came who were invited,
Ruth Higgins, Dorothy Avery and
Dolly Russel among the number. Marian
went into the sitting-room with drooping
head and misery in her soul, until joining in
the games and merriment, she forgot the
cookies and had a good time. Not a thought
of trouble disturbed her pleasure even though
she heard Lala setting the table in the dining-room.</p>

<p>Her conscience awoke only when Aunt
Amelia appeared to summon her into the
kitchen. Every bit of color left the child's
face. She could hear nothing clearly because
of the ringing in her ears. As she followed
Aunt Amelia through the dining-room the
floor seemed rising up at every step and the
candles on the birthday cake danced before her
eyes. On the table in the kitchen was the
empty cooky jar, the eloquent witness of her
guilt. On a rosebud plate beside it were less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
than a dozen cookies. Marian gazed stupidly
at the jar and at the plate of cookies.</p>

<p>"What have you to say for yourself, Marian
Lee?" Aunt Amelia's voice sounded far
away. There were such lumps in Marian's
throat she couldn't speak.</p>

<p>"Answer me," commanded Aunt Amelia,
"what have you to say?"</p>

<p>Marian's tongue felt paralyzed. Perhaps it
was unwilling to do its owner's bidding. It
was certainly hard for that truthful little
tongue to say the one word "Nothing." Aunt
Amelia's face was terrible. "Do you mean
to tell me that you haven't touched those
cookies?"</p>

<p>There was no retreat. Marian nodded her
head.</p>

<p>"Speak!" continued Aunt Amelia, "say
yes or no? Do you dare to tell me that you
didn't take the cookies?"</p>

<p>It was all Marian did dare to do and her
reply was "Yes."</p>

<p>Aunt Amelia raised a long forefinger as
she said, "Don't stand there and lie, Marian
Lee, you took those cookies."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not." Lala grew pale when she
heard that answer and saw the terrified eyes
of the child.</p>

<p>"Own up," she whispered as she passed
the trembling sinner on her way to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Marian looked beseechingly at Aunt Amelia,
but her face was hard and pitiless. The child
dared not "Be brave." "I did not touch the
cookies," she repeated again and again.</p>

<p>"How do you account for the disappearance
of a whole jar of cookies, Marian, if you
didn't eat them?" asked Uncle George upon
his arrival.</p>

<p>Marian had not thought of accounting for
the loss of the cookies, but she took a deep
breath and made a suggestion. "I s'pose a
hungry tramp took 'em."</p>

<p>The reply wasn't satisfactory. Uncle George
frowned and Aunt Amelia smiled. The smile
wasn't the kind she was in the habit of bestowing
upon Ella. It was the sort that
froze the blood in Marian's veins. She sank
in a miserable little heap upon the floor and
cried and cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Reform school is the place for children
who steal and lie," said Aunt Amelia.</p>

<p>Uncle George tried to make the child confess,
but his efforts were vain. She would
not. Threats were powerless. The more
frightened Marian became the more vehemently
she denied her guilt. Although it
was Ella's birthday, and shouts of laughter
could be heard from the sitting-room, Aunt
Amelia produced a certain strap Marian was
familiar with through past experience.
"Spare the rod, spoil the child," was Mrs.
St. Claire's favorite motto so far as her husband's
small relative was concerned.</p>

<p>"You can whip me till I die," sobbed
Marian when she saw the strap, "but I can't
say I took the cookies, because I didn't. How
can I say I did, when I didn't?" Nor could
Aunt Amelia nor Uncle George compel the
child to say anything different.</p>

<p>"You can whip me till I die," she insisted
over and over, "but I can't say I took
those cookies," and they finally believed
her.</p>

<p>"Go to bed," commanded Aunt Amelia. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
don't want to see a child who could die easier
than she could tell the truth. Go!"</p>

<p>A smothered sob caught Marian's ear.
Lala was crying; and because Lala cried and
was soon after found in Marian's room trying
to quiet her, she was sent away the next day.
Tilly was her successor. Before she had been
in the house a week, she openly befriended
Marian. "Poor little thing," she said, "if
you had stolen a barrel of cookies from a
baker you wouldn't have deserved half of the
punishment you get. There isn't anything
left they can do to you, is there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they can send me to the reform
school," was the reply, "and, oh, dear, I'm
afraid to go. What will become of me?"</p>

<p>"If I were you," Tilly advised, "and I
took the cookies, I would own up. They
can't any more than kill you and I guess
they'll do that anyway."</p>

<p>Marian shook her head. The time to own
up was long passed. She stayed in her room
and ate bread and water a week without protest.
On Sunday afternoon she listened to
the story of Ananias and Sapphira with teet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>h
and fists tightly closed. She heard long
speeches on the fearful consequences of stealing
and lying, without a word. Only when
questioned would she say in low spiritless
tones, "I did not touch the cookies."</p>

<p>When it was all over, and Aunt Amelia
and Uncle George gave up trying to wring a
confession from her and the child was simply
in disgrace, her own conscience began its
work. It gave her no peace. Marian had
said her prayers every night as Mrs. Moore
had taught her when she was a baby; but she
had repeated them quickly with her back
turned towards heaven and had made no
mention of cookies. At last, troubled by her
conscience, and not knowing where to turn
for comfort, Marian knelt by her bedside one
night and tried an experiment.</p>

<p>"O Lord," she began, "I am not going to
lie to you about the cookies. Thou knowest
I took them. That is why I haven't said any
made up prayers for so long. I knew Thou
knewest how wicked I am and I know what
the Bible says about lying lips. I am afraid
of Aunt Amelia or I would own up. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
says I won't go to heaven when I die because
I am too bad to live there. Now, O Lord, I
know I could be good in heaven, but it has
been hard work on earth, and after I took the
cookies I got wickeder and wickeder, but
honest and truth I'll never do anything wrong
again and I'll never tell another lie. Thou
knowest I could be good in heaven. Please,
O Lord, forgive me and take me straight up
to heaven when I die. Amen."</p>

<p>That prayer didn't help Marian a bit. She
could scarcely get off her knees when she had
said "Amen." Her head seemed bowed down
beneath a weight of cookies.</p>

<p>"You know what you must do," insisted
her conscience, "you must go to your Uncle
George and your Aunt Amelia first, first, I say."</p>

<p>"But I can't do that, and I'm so unhappy,"
sobbed Marian, but her conscience was pitiless.
It would allow no compromise. "Oh, if I
could see Nanna," whispered Marian as she
crept into bed. No one had ever kissed her
good-night but once since she had left the
Home, and now, no one ever would again.
The Father in heaven had turned away His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
face. Marian cried herself to sleep as she had
many a night before.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night she awoke and
sat up in bed, cold and trembling. Thunder
was rolling through the sky and an occasional
flash of lightning made the little room bright
one minute and inky black the next. Perhaps
the end of the world was coming when
the graves would give up their dead and the
terrible Judge would descend to deal with the
wicked. A crash of thunder shook the house.
Marian dived beneath the blankets, but a horrible
thought caused her to sit bolt upright
again. Aunt Amelia had told her that sinners,
on the last day, would call for the rocks
and mountains to fall upon them. Perhaps
hiding beneath blankets meant the same thing.
Another crash came and a blinding flash
of lightning. Then another and another.
Springing from her bed, Marian ran down
the hall to Mrs. St. Claire's room. The
door was closed but the room was lighted.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me come in," she cried, knocking
frantically at the door and keeping her eye
upon the crack of light at the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>The response was immediate. Aunt Amelia
stepped into the hall and closed the door behind
her. "Go back to your room," she said,
"and don't you dare leave it again. I should
think you would expect the lightning to
strike you!"</p>

<p>Marian shrank back as a flash of lightning
illumined the hall. For one moment she
saw Aunt Amelia, tall and terrible in her
white night-dress, her voice more fearful than
the thunder, and her form seeming to stretch
upward and upward, growing thinner and thinner
until it vanished in the awful darkness.</p>

<p>Marian fled, closing the door of her little
room and placing a chair against it. Kneeling
by the window, she closed her eyes to
shut out glimpses of the unnatural garden below
and the angry sky above. The thought
of sudden death filled her with terror. What
would become of her soul if she died with her
sins unconfessed? "Dear Father in heaven,"
she cried, "if you have to kill me with lightning,
forgive me and take me to heaven.
I'll be good there. I'll never steal anything
there nor ever lie again. I was going to own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
up to Aunt Amelia, but O Lord, I was so
afraid of her I didn't dare. If you'll let me
live through this night, I'll go and tell her in
the morning and then I'll never do wrong
again. O Lord, I'm so sorry, and I'm awful
afraid of lightning. I don't want to die by
it, but if I have to, please take me up to
heaven. Amen."</p>

<p>Then Marian went back to bed. Her conscience
didn't say a word that time and she
went to sleep before the storm was over, long
before Ella was quieted or ever Aunt Amelia
closed her eyes.</p>

<p>Marian's first waking thought when she
looked out on the fresh brightness of another
day was one of thankfulness. It was good to
be alive. Another second and she groaned.
Perhaps she would have been dead but for
that midnight promise, the promise she must
keep. Marian dressed quickly and sought
Aunt Amelia before she lost courage. She
wasn't gone long. Back she flew to the little
room where her prayer was short although
her sobs were long.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, I couldn't, I just couldn't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>There were many thunder-storms that
summer and for a while every one of
them frightened Marian. In the night,
she would resolve to confess, but daylight
took away her courage. "If I should be
sick a long time," Marian argued, "perhaps
then Aunt Amelia would like me some and
just before I died I could shut my eyes and
tell her about the cookies. Then God would
surely forgive me and I would go straight up
to heaven and it would be all right. But if
I should die suddenly, before I had any time
to say any last words, what would become of
me?" she asked herself. After thinking of it
some time, Marian hit upon a plan that
brought her peace of mind. She wrote the
following confession:</p>

<p>"Nobody knows how much I have suffered
on account of some cookies. I used to like
cookies but not now. It began by sugar. I
took lumps of sugar out of a barrel for a boy.
I thought if I could take sugar I could take
cookies, too, and I did, but I said I didn't.
I did take the cookies. I hope my folks will
forgive me now I am dead. I suffered awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
before I died on account of cookies. Give
my wax doll and all my things to Ella. The
doll is good if I wasn't. I tried but it is hard
for some children on earth. I am awful sorry
on account of being so much trouble to everybody.
I took those cookies. Marian Lee."</p>

<p>Having folded this paper, Marian was happier
than she had been for weeks. She felt
that she had saved her soul.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="c">MARIAN'S DIARY</p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">June</span> 20.&mdash;It is hard to begin a diary.
You don't know what to say first. Bernice
Jones says a diary is a book to put the weather
in. She ought to know on account of her
grandmother keeping one. Leonore Whiting,
the girl that sits behind me and wears the
prettiest ribbons in school, says a diary is to
put your feelings in. Leonore thinks she
ought to know because her sister is a poetry
writer.</p>

<p>"When I asked Uncle George for an empty
diary and what you write in it, he laughed
and said he would give me all the paper I
wanted to write things in and I had better
put down everything. He said it would be a
good thing for me to write more and talk less,
so I guess I will have the fullest diary of any
of the Diary Club. That's our name. Maud
Brown was the one that got up the name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
She says everybody belongs to a Club. Her
mother does and her father and her brothers
too. Maud says she has got to be in a Club
or she never will be happy. She is only going
to keep weather because she doesn't like to
write. Leonore and a lot of the other girls
are just going to keep a few feelings, but I am
going to write down weather and feelings and
everything.</p>

<p>"The weather is all right to-day.</p>

<p>"It is too bad about vacation. It is almost
here and then I won't have anybody to play
with. Uncle George says he never saw a little
girl like to go to school as well as I do. It
really isn't school I like to go to, it is recesses.
I guess he had some other boys to play with
when he was little or he would know. I
would like to play with Dolly Russel but my
aunt never will let me go over there and she
tells Dolly's mother 'No,' about everything
she wants me to do. She did let Ella go, only
they don't invite Ella any more. I wonder if
she talked too much, or broke anything, or
why? Lala works over there now, but my
aunt told me not to talk to Lala so I don't dare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I found out something to-day at school.
The children that live in houses don't all go
to bed in the dark. I cried and cried when I
first had to go to bed in the dark because
where I used to live, we didn't have to. I
wish I could sit up late at night.</p>

<p>"Another thing about a diary is how nice it
will be for your grandchildren to know what
you used to think about and what you used
to do. I can hardly believe that I am the
grandmother of my own grandchildren, but
of course it is so.</p>

<p>"June 21.&mdash;We took our diaries to school.
I had the most written of anybody, but I
don't think it is nice to read your diary out
loud because they ask questions. The girls
wanted to know where I used to live and I
wanted to tell them but I didn't dare to, and
now I wonder about things. Louise Fisher
said that Dolly Russel's mother told her
mother that my aunt is not good to me, and
a good many more things, and they are all
sorry for me and they say it is too bad I can't
have pretty clothes like Ella. I didn't say
much because I don't want everybody in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
school to know how bad I am and that nobody
can love me, and about the cookies. I
guess I would die if they knew it all. Their
mothers wouldn't let them play with me at
recess.</p>

<p>"I wish I had a white dress to wear the
last day of school when I sing a song alone
and speak my piece. I don't like to sing and
speak pieces because I am afraid. I am not
going to take my diary to school any more.</p>

<p>"June 22.&mdash;I don't know what to think.
I heard some more things about me at school
to-day. Folks wonder who I am and where I
came from, and Louise Fisher says she knows
Uncle George is not my own uncle and if she
was me she would run away. I can't run
away because I don't know where to run to
and I am afraid. Ella knows things about
me and if she ever gets a chance I guess she
will tell me, but her mother won't let her
speak to me if she can help it. I guess her
mother doesn't know how hard I try to set
Ella a good example of being polite and not
slamming doors and speak when you're spoken
to, and children should be seen and not heard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and if you behave as well as you look you'll
be all right.</p>

<p>"I know it was bad about the cookies, but
Ella never can do a cooky sin because her
mother always says to her, 'Help yourself,
darling,' and that's different. Besides that,
Ella thinks a tramp did take the cookies. I
will tell her some time because she cried and
was sorry I had so much trouble. Then she
will never speak to me again, but it is better
to tell the truth than to do any other way.
When I think I am going to die, sure, then I
will tell my aunt if it kills me.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Uncle George is my uncle or
what?</p>

<p>"June 23.&mdash;It was the last day of school
to-day. I sung my song and spoke my piece
and Dolly Russel's mother kissed me. I wish
she was my mother. I wish I had a mother.
I am glad she kissed me. Aunt Amelia
wasn't there. Ella cried because she couldn't
go. It didn't rain. You don't think about
weather when it is nice.</p>

<p>"September 5.&mdash;The queerest thing happened.
I thought I would be the one that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
would write the most in my diary this summer,
but I wasn't, and good reason why. It
was just a little after daylight the day after
the last day of school, that Aunt Amelia came
and called me and told me to get dressed
quick, and she gave me all clean clothes to
put on and I was frightened. I said what had
I done and she said I had done enough. I
was scared worse than ever. She told me to
go down in the kitchen and I would find
some breakfast ready. I thought I couldn't
eat, everything was so queer and early, but I
did, and then I had to put on my hat and
Uncle George said, 'Are you ready?' I said
where am I going, is it reform school, and
Aunt Amelia said it ought to be, and then I
got in a carriage with Uncle George and the
driver put a little new trunk on behind and
we drove to the depot.</p>

<p>"It was awful early and the grass and the
trees looked queer and the birds were singing
like everything. Uncle George told me to
cheer up, I was going to a nice place where I
would have a good time, and he told me to
write to him every week and he would write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to me. He said I mustn't tell the folks where
I was going that I was ever bad. He said he
thought I was a pretty good little girl, and
when he put me on the train and told the
conductor where I was going and to take care
of me, because I was his little girl, I put my
arms around his neck and kissed him good-bye.
He is a good man. I hope he is my
uncle, but I don't know.</p>

<p>"Well, I had a nice time in that village
where I went and Uncle George came after
me yesterday. I was glad to see him, but I
didn't want to come home. I wanted to stay
and go to the country school, but he said that
my grandchildren would want their grandmother
to know something.</p>

<p>"Then he told me he found my diary and
that he put it away where nobody could see it
until I got back. He said he thought he had
better tell me to keep my diary out of sight,
because that was the style among diary-writing
folks. So I will hide my diary now.
I wonder if he read it. Anyway, I know
Aunt Amelia didn't get a chance, because he
told me most particular about how he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
it first thing and put it where it wouldn't get
dusty. He says he is my Uncle George. I
was afraid maybe I was just adopted for a
niece, and I am not sure yet. He didn't say
he wasn't my adopted Uncle George, and
maybe he thought I was his brother's little
girl when I wasn't. The folks I stayed with
told Uncle George I am a lovely child. He
didn't look surprised, only glad.</p>

<p>"September 6.&mdash;All the girls had new
dresses at school. I am in the fourth grade
this term. I am in fractions and on the map
of South America. We played London Bridge
and King William at recess.</p>

<p>"September 7.&mdash;Too many things to play
after school. Can't write. Aunt Amelia
makes me get straight to bed after I come to
my room at night. It doesn't seem like
night, though. I don't like to go to bed in
the afternoon very well, but after all, I am
glad it doesn't get dark early. I go to sleep
in the daytime and wake up in the daytime
and the birds are always singing.</p>

<p>"September 8.&mdash;Nothing happened in school
to-day. It rains and I can't go out in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
orchard. I was going to play 'Landing of
the Pilgrims,' but I guess I will write in my
diary. Where I was this summer they had a
library, not a big one like the one down-stairs,
but the shelves were low so I could
reach the books, and the folks let me read all
I wanted to. I was pretty glad of it, rainy
days and Sundays.</p>

<p>"The book I liked best was full of stories
about the Norsemen. They gave me the book
to keep. I take it way up in the top of my
favorite apple-tree and read and read. Sometimes
I play I'm Odin and sometimes I am
Thor. I am not so afraid of thunder since I
read about Thor. When it thunders and lightens
I play I am an old Norseman and that I
really believe Thor is pounding with his big
hammer and that he is scaring the bad frost
giants. I am glad Aunt Amelia says she
never read Norse stories. If she had, she
would call me Loki, so there's somebody that's
bad she can't say I am.</p>

<p>"What I like best is to sit in the top of the
apple-tree and shut the book and think about
the Rainbow Bridge that stretched from earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to heaven. Every one couldn't cross, but if
my father and my mother were on the other
side of the shining bridge, I would look
straight towards them and I wouldn't look
down and my mother would hold out her
arms and I wouldn't be afraid. May be the
Rainbow Bridge is wide. I am sure it is
when I stop to think, because the gods used
to drive over it when they came to visit the
earth. Perhaps they would let me cross if
they saw me coming because it was only the
bad giants they tried to keep out of heaven.
Oh, dear, I guess I am a bad giant myself,
even if I am little, because the book says,
'The giants in old Norse times were not easy
to conquer: but generally it was when they
hid themselves behind lies and appeared to be
what they were not that they succeeded for a
time.' I hid myself behind lies.</p>

<p>"September 9.&mdash;One sure thing, I will always
tell the truth as long as I live. I didn't
come straight home from school to-night. A
lot of us girls went in the old cemetery and
read what's on the tombstones, and I didn't
get home early. I tried to get through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
gate when my aunt wasn't looking, but that
would have been what you call good luck.
She took me in and said, 'Where have you
been?' I said, 'In the graveyard.' She said,
'Why didn't you stay there?' I didn't know
what to answer so I kept still. Then my aunt
said, 'You can't go out to play,' and that was
all. So I am always going to tell the truth
and feel comfortable inside, no matter what
happens. I was more afraid of how I would
feel when it was time to say my prayers if I
told a lie, than I was of my aunt.</p>

<p>"September 10.&mdash;I didn't get home early
to-night because I walked around the pond
with Louise Fisher and Maud Brown. I
owned up when I got home. I am not going
to write down what happened, but it was
worse than just being sent to your room. I
don't want my little grandchildren to read
about it. I am coming straight home next
Monday night.</p>

<p>"September 11.&mdash;Aunt Amelia says I act
worse all the time. I don't know what I did
that was bad to-day, but I got scolded all the
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"September 12.&mdash;Went to church and Sunday-school
and the boys made fun of my
shoes. They couldn't make me cry. I should
think I would get used to being made fun of
because I have to wear a sunbonnet to school
and all the other little girls wear hats. I wear
my sunbonnet as far as my aunt can see and
then I take it off and swing it by the strings.
She would be angry if she knew. I would almost
rather be baldheaded than wear a sunbonnet
when all the other girls wear hats. I
wish I could have pretty shoes for Sundays,
but I won't let the boys know I care.</p>

<p>"September 13.&mdash;I came straight home to-night.
I wish school began at daylight and
didn't let out till dark, there is so much
trouble at home. Uncle George says it is all
on account of me.</p>

<p>"September 14.&mdash;I came straight home and
got scolded.</p>

<p>"September 15.&mdash;Got scolded again.</p>

<p>"September 16.&mdash;Got scolded some more.</p>

<p>"September 17.&mdash;Got put to bed without
any supper on account of sitting down by the
side of the pond to watch a frog. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
funny frog and when I had to go to bed, I
went to sleep thinking about it. When it was
almost dark Uncle George came and woke me
up to give me something to eat. He didn't
scold. I am writing this the next morning
for yesterday.</p>

<p>"September 18.&mdash;It was a beautiful Saturday.
My aunt had company and I played out
in the orchard all day long. Ella and my
aunt and the company went to drive in the
afternoon so there wasn't anybody to scold me.
I saw the mole to-day. He came out and
walked around a little. I guess he knew my
aunt was gone. Everything was happy in the
orchard. I watched a caterpillar a long time.
He went so fast he made me laugh. I guess
he was going home from school and wanted to
get there in time.</p>

<p>"September 19.&mdash;This is Sunday. Uncle
George called me in the parlor to sing for the
company and some other folks that came.
Aunt Amelia played on the piano and when she
couldn't play any more on account of a cramp
in her wrist, they told me to sing without any
music and I did. The company wiped away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
some tears, and she said I could sing just the
way my father did when he was a little boy,
and then she took me in her lap and said she
thought I looked like my mother. I was going
to ask some questions, but my aunt said
not to talk about some things, and then the
company said it was going to rain, she guessed,
and would I sing another song. I did and
then my aunt sent me to my room, cross. I
mean she was cross. I felt pretty bad at first
but I got over it.</p>

<p>"September 20.&mdash;Ella says there is a picture
of my father in the album, and she will show
it to me first chance she gets.</p>

<p>"September 21.&mdash;My aunt was away when
I got home from school so Ella said, 'Now's
your chance,' and we went into the parlor and
she showed me the picture. I smiled back at
the face because it smiled at me. My father is
pleasant and kind.</p>

<p>"September 22.&mdash;I went in the parlor and
looked at the picture again. I was afraid my
aunt would come in and find me.</p>

<p>"September 23.&mdash;It happened to-day. I
was looking at the picture and my aunt came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
in still and caught me. She said dreadful
things, and I cried and I don't know what I
did, but she said I was saucy and she didn't
know what to do with me. Uncle George
heard the noise and came in and he scolded,
too. I never saw him so cross. I almost
thought he was angry with Aunt Amelia, but
of course that was not so. At last he took my
father's picture out of the album and gave it
to me, and told me to keep it, and he told me
not to go in my aunt's parlor because she
didn't want me there. I knew that before, because
I wanted to take lessons on the piano
same as Ella, and she wouldn't let me.</p>

<p>"I am so glad I have my father's picture.
It is like having folks of your own to
have a picture of somebody that was yours.
I haven't missed a single question in
school on the map of South America. I
guess that is one map I can't forget. I wish
I knew where my father went in South
America. I don't dare ask Uncle George.
He says I am the trial of his life, and he
doesn't see why I don't behave like other
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"October 1.&mdash;I am getting so I don't care
what happens to me. I don't come straight
home from school any more. I always think
I will until I get started home, and then I
dread to come because nobody loves me and I
will get scoldings and things anyway, so I stop
and look at toads and frogs and have a good
time before I get home, and sometimes nothing
happens. My aunt says I tell things, but
I don't. What would I tell for? I don't
even write sad things in my diary because I
don't want to make my grandchildren cry. It
would make me feel pretty bad if I found out
that nobody loved my grandmother.</p>

<p>"October 2.&mdash;Had a lovely time playing
Pocahontas in the grove.</p>

<p>"October 3.&mdash;I tried to count the stars last
night, but I couldn't. I wonder why we don't
fall off the earth when China's on top?
Aunt Amelia says I ought to know better than
to ask her questions. I do.</p>

<p>"October 20.&mdash;I listened to what the minister
said to-day. It was about heaven. I've
got to try to be awful good on earth so I can
surely go there. Then I guess somebody will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
love me and when I walk in through one of
the pearly gates, the angels won't look cross.</p>

<p>"October 21.&mdash;You get tired of keeping
your diary. I am going to write a book.
Its name will be 'The Little Daughter of
Thor.' I guess Thor never had a little girl,
but I am going to write it in a book that he
did, and one day when the little girl was a
baby and she was playing with the golden apples,
she fell right through the sky on to the
earth. Then I am going to write about how
the little girl watched for the Rainbow Bridge.
She was a little stray child on earth, and even
the giants were kind to her. Of course Thor's
little daughter would know enough to know
that the only way home was over the blue and
golden Rainbow Bridge that she couldn't see
only sometimes.</p>

<p>"At the end of the story, Thor himself will
find the little girl and will take her in his
chariot across the Rainbow Bridge to the
shining bright city in the clouds where her
mother will hug her pretty near to pieces.
Maybe when I get the book done, I will
write another about what Thor's little daugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>ter
did when she got home. About the songs
she used to sing with her mother, and the
flowers they used to pick and about everything
that is happiness. It will be nicer to
do than keeping an old diary about real
things.</p>

<p>"The nicest looking man's picture I ever
saw is my father, so I am going to have him
for Thor. My father looks kind and smiling,
but he looks, too, as if he would know how to
use Thor's big hammer if the bad giants tried
to cross the Rainbow Bridge. I think it is
queer that I like the god of thunder so well
that I will let him have my father's face in my
book.</p>

<p>"October 22.&mdash;I am going to put some last
words in my diary, just to say that it is a
good thing to write a book. Something
dreadful happened after school to-night. I
felt dreadful, nobody knows. I got over it
though, and then because I had to stay in
my room and have dry bread and water for
my supper, I started my book and it was lots
of fun. It is the best thing there is to do
when you want to forget you are a little girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
that nobody loves. If I live here until I am
an old lady I presume I will turn into an
author.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for the orchard and the locust
grove and the way home from school, and
recesses and my doll and my books, and the
birds and the wild flowers and the lovely
blue sky I can see from my window this
minute, and a good many other things, I
would wish I had died when I was a baby.
That makes me laugh. It is a nice world to
live in after all. A beautiful world."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="c">DIPHTHERIA</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the winter, diphtheria broke out
in the schools. Marian said little about it at
home, fearing she might not be allowed to go,
though the daily paper told the whole story.
Why the schools were not closed was a question
even in the long ago days when Marian
was a child. Uncle George was indignant,
but influenced by his wife's arguments, he
allowed Marian to have her way. Mrs. St.
Claire said Marian was better off in school
than at home, and in no more danger of
catching diphtheria than she would be hanging
over the fence talking to passing children.
Marian didn't tell her Uncle George that she
was never allowed to speak to passing children.
He might have kept her home.</p>

<p>Weeks passed and many little ones died.
The schoolroom became a solemn place to
Marian. It seemed strange to look at empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
seats and know that the ones who used to sit
in them would never come to school again.
Even the boys were quieter than ever before.
There were no longer paper wads flying the
minute the teacher's back was turned, perhaps
because the chief mischief maker's curly
head was missing. He was Tommy Jewel,
and he made things lively at the beginning
of the term.</p>

<p>Marian felt that it was something to have
known so many girls and boys who died. At
recess in the basement she used to ask children
from the other rooms how many of
their number were missing. Marian felt so
well and full of life it never entered her head
that she might be taken ill herself, and the
thought of death was impossible, although
she often closed her eyes and folded her
hands, trying to imagine her school-days
were over.</p>

<p>At home the children met but seldom after
the outbreak of diphtheria. Marian ate her
breakfast alone and Ella had hers when the
little cousin had gone to school. It was
easily possible for Mrs. St. Claire to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
children entirely separate. To guard Ella
from all danger of contagion was her daily
care and the smell of burning sulphur was
ever present in the house.</p>

<p>One morning Marian's throat was sore and
she felt ill. The child dressed quickly and
went down to tell Uncle George. Tilly the
maid was at her home on a short visit, and
Uncle George was building the kitchen
fire.</p>

<p>"I've got the diphtheria," announced
Marian, and there was terror in her face.</p>

<p>"Let me look in your throat," said Uncle
George. "Why it looks all right, Marian,
just a little red."</p>

<p>"I don't care, I feel sick all over," insisted
the child, "and I tell you now and then, I
know I've got it."</p>

<p>When Aunt Amelia was called she said
Marian imagined that her throat was sore and
as Marian ate breakfast, she was sent to
school. The child went away crying. She
didn't swing her little dinner pail around
and around that morning just to show that
she could do it and keep the cover on. Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
George was inclined to call her back, but
Aunt Amelia laughed at him.</p>

<p>"Any child," argued Mrs. St. Claire, "that
could eat the breakfast she did, isn't at death's
door, now you mark my words. She has let
her imagination run away with her. Our
darling Ella is far more apt to have diphtheria
than that child. She would be willing to
have the disease to get a little sympathy."</p>

<p>Marian felt better out in the fresh air and
as she met Ellen Day soon after leaving home,
the way to school seemed short. The chief
ambition of Marian's school life was to sit on
a back seat, yet from the beginning, it had
been her lot to belong to the front row. The
teachers had a way of putting her there and
Marian knew the reason. It wasn't because
she was the smallest child in the room, although
that was the truth. Tommy Jewel
used to sit on a front seat, too, and once
Marian had to share the platform with him.
The teacher said they were a good pair and
the other children laughed. Possibly the
memory of Tommy's mischievous face caused
the teacher to notice how quiet Marian was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the morning her throat was sore. The child
sat with her elbows on her desk, her face in
her hands, staring solemnly into space.</p>

<p>"Are you ill, Marian?" asked the teacher.</p>

<p>"No, Miss Beck," the child answered, recalling
her aunt's remarks.</p>

<p>At last, conscious of pathetic eyes following
her about the room and having heard of Aunt
Amelia, the teacher again questioned Marian.
"What is the trouble, little girl? Is there
anything you would like to do? Would you
like to write on the blackboard?"</p>

<p>Marian's face lighted. "I wish I could sit
in that empty back seat all day," she eagerly
suggested.</p>

<p>The teacher smiled. "You may pack your
books, Marian, and sit there until I miss you
so much I shall need you down here again."</p>

<p>Marian knew what that meant. "I'll be
awful good," she promised. "I mean, I'll be
ever so good."</p>

<p>So Marian sat in a back seat that last day
and in spite of her sore throat and headache,
she was happy. It was triumph to sit in a
back seat. She was glad the children looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
around and smiled. They might get bad marks
for turning their heads, to be sure, but what
of it? At recess Marian walked across the
schoolroom once or twice, then returned
to her seat. At noon she refused to go to
the basement with the children to eat her
luncheon. In fact, she couldn't eat. Marian
wondered why time seemed so long.</p>

<p>When the history class was called to the
recitation seat early in the afternoon, one
little girl was motionless when the signals
were given.</p>

<p>"Marian Lee's asleep," volunteered the
child who sat in front of her.</p>

<p>At that, Marian raised her head and stumbled
to her class.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel well?" asked the teacher.</p>

<p>Marian shook her head. Her cheeks were
crimson. She had never felt so wretched.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you had better go
home?" continued Miss Beck.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," answered the child in tones of
alarm. "Oh, she wouldn't let me come home
before school is out."</p>

<p>"There, there, don't cry," begged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
teacher. "You may go back to your seat if
you wish."</p>

<p>Marian did so and was soon asleep again.
At recess she awoke to find herself alone in
the room with Miss Beck.</p>

<p>"You had better go home, dear," the teacher
urged. "I am sure you are ill. Let me help
you put on your coat and hood."</p>

<p>"I can't go home until school is out," and
Marian began to cry.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because on account of my aunt. She
wouldn't let me come home."</p>

<p>"But you are ill, Marian."</p>

<p>"She won't let me be sick," was the sobbing
reply, "and I don't dare go home. You don't
know my aunt. I guess I feel better. I want
to go where it isn't so hot."</p>

<p>The teacher was young and hopeful. "Perhaps
you will feel better if you go out to
play," was her reply.</p>

<p>Instead of going out of doors, Marian went
into the basement and joined in a game of
blind man's buff. Only a few minutes and
she fell upon the floor in a dead faint. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the child opened her eyes she found herself
the centre of attraction. The basement was
quiet as though the command had been given
to "Form lines." A strange teacher was
holding Marian and Miss Beck was bathing
her face with a damp handkerchief. Her
playmates stood about in little groups, whispering
the dread word "Diphtheria." Miss
Beck came to her senses and ordered the children
into the fresh air. How to send Marian
home was the next question. The child listened
to the various suggestions and then,
struggling to her feet declared that she would
walk home alone. She couldn't imagine what
her aunt might say if she did anything else.</p>

<p>The child had her way. Through the gate
and down the road she went alone. The journey
was long and the wind was cold. The
little feet were never so weary as that December
day. It seemed to Marian that she
could never reach home. Finally she passed
the church. Seven more houses after that,
then a turn to the right and two more houses.
If she dared sit down on the edge of the sidewalk
and rest by the way, but that wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
do. "I could never stir again," she thought
and plodded on.</p>

<p>At last she reached her own gate and saw
Ella at the window. Would Aunt Amelia
scold? It would be good to get in where it
was warm, anyway. Oh, if Aunt Amelia
would open the front door and say, "Come in
this way, Marian," but she didn't and the
child stumbled along a few more steps to the
back entrance. She was feeling her way
through the house when Aunt Amelia stopped
her in the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Don't come any further," said she. "I
have callers in the parlor. What are you
home in the middle of the afternoon for?"</p>

<p>"I've got the diphtheria," the child replied,
and her voice was thick.</p>

<p>Aunt Amelia made no reply but returned
immediately through the sitting-room to the
parlor.</p>

<p>"I guess she knows I'm sick now," Marian
whispered as she sank into a chair by the
table and pushed her dinner pail back to make
room for her aching head. The callers left.
Marian heard the front door open and close.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Then Aunt Amelia hastily entered the dining-room,
threw a quantity of sulphur upon
the stove and went back, closing the door behind
her. Another door closed and Marian
knew that her aunt was in the parlor with
Ella.</p>

<p>The child choked and strangled and called
to her aunt. She tried to walk and couldn't
stand. The fumes of burning sulphur grew
stronger and stronger. The air was blue.
Marian became terrified as no one replied to
her calls, but in time a merciful feeling of rest
and quiet stole over her and her head fell forward
upon the table.</p>

<p>For a long time she knew nothing. Then
came dreams and visions. Part of the time
Marian recalled that she was home from school
early and that she had not taken off her hood
and coat. Again she wondered where she was
and why it was so still. Then came an awful
dread of death. Where was everybody and
what would become of her? The thought of
death aroused Marian as nothing else had
done. Would she be left to die alone? She
remembered that some of her schoolmates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
were ill with diphtheria but a few hours before
the end came. Where was Aunt Amelia?
Had she gone away from the house? Marian
could not lift her head and when she tried to
call her aunt her voice was a smothered whisper.
What she suffered before her uncle came
was a story long untold. Things happened
when Uncle George walked into the house.
He aired the room and there was wrath in his
voice as he demanded explanations.</p>

<p>"Have patience a minute more, little girl,
and it will be all right," he said to Marian, as
he brought a cot into the room and quickly
made a bed. Then he undressed her, put her
in bed and grabbed his hat.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't leave me," begged Marian,
"please don't, Uncle George, I'm awful sick
and I'm afraid when I'm alone."</p>

<p>"I'm going for the doctor," was the reply;
"lie still and trust Uncle George."</p>

<p>The man was gone but a moment and soon
after he returned, the doctor came. It was
no easy matter to look in Marian's throat. It
needed more than the handle of a spoon to
hold down the poor little tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Am I going to die right off?" demanded
the child. "Oh, if I can only live I'll be so
good. I'll never do anything bad again. Tell
me quick, have I got to die to-night?"</p>

<p>For a time it seemed useless to try to quiet
the little girl. "Oh, I'm afraid to die," she
moaned, "I don't dare to die. Aunt Amelia
says I won't go to heaven and I'm afraid. I
don't want to tell what she does say. Oh,
Uncle George, don't let me die. Tell the doctor
you want me to get well. Tell him I'll
be good."</p>

<p>Uncle George sat down and covered his
face with his hands when Marian told him
she couldn't hear what he said, that it was
dark and she wanted more light so she could
see his face that she might know if he was
angry. Then she called for Aunt Amelia,
and Aunt Amelia would not come; she was
afraid of the diphtheria.</p>

<p>"But if I'm going to die, I've got to tell
her," cried the child, clutching at the air, and
it was some time before Uncle George understood.</p>

<p>"Child, child, don't speak of cookies," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
begged, "that was all right long ago;" but
the assurance fell upon unheeding ears.</p>

<p>The nurse came and went up-stairs to prepare
a room for Marian. The woman's appearance
convinced the child that there was
no hope&mdash;she was surely going to die. Uncle
George groaned as he listened to her ravings.</p>

<p>At last the doctor put down his medicine
case and drew a chair close beside the cot.
He was a big man with a face that little children
trusted. He took both of Marian's small,
burning hands in one of his and told her she
must look at him and listen to what he had
to tell her. Uncle George moved uneasily.
He thought the doctor was about to explain
to Marian that unless she kept more quiet,
nothing would save her, she would have to
die. The man was surprised when he heard
what the kind physician said. He talked to
Marian of the friend of little children and of
the beautiful home beyond the skies. Nor
would he allow her to interrupt, but patiently
and quietly told her over and over that the
One who took little children up in His arms
and blessed them, didn't ask whether they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
were good or bad. He loved them all. The
sins of little children were surely forgiven.</p>

<p>The troubled brain of the child grasped the
meaning at last. There was nothing to fear.
She closed her eyes and was quiet for a few
moments. When she began to talk again, it
was of summer mornings and apple-blossoms,
of the wild birds and the chipmunk that lived
in the locust grove. Many days passed before
Marian realized anything more: then she
knew that Uncle George took care of her
nights and the nurse came every morning.</p>

<p>"Where is my aunt?" asked the child.
"Doesn't she come up here?"</p>

<p>"Your aunt and little cousin," replied the
nurse, "stay by themselves in the front part
of the house down-stairs. They are afraid of
the diphtheria."</p>

<p>Marian stared at the wall. She was glad to
know there was no danger that Aunt Amelia
might walk in, but somehow it seemed better
not to tell the nurse.</p>

<p>"Am I going to die?" she asked.</p>

<p>The question came so suddenly the nurse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
was taken by surprise. "Why&mdash;why we hope
not," was the reply.</p>

<p>Something in the tones of the woman's
voice impressed the truth upon Marian's mind.
She was far more likely to die than to live.
"I only wanted to know," she remarked,
"I'm not afraid any more. I only hope I
won't be a grown up angel the first thing. I
should like to be a little girl with a mother
and live in one of the many mansions for a
while, like other children. I'd pick flowers in
the front yard."</p>

<p>Soon after, the child fell asleep. When she
awoke she was delirious, talking continually
about the Rainbow Bridge. The doctor came,
but it was hours before the Rainbow Bridge
faded away and Marian was quiet. That was
the day the little pilgrim seemed near the
journey's end. Until sunset, Uncle George
watched each fluttering breath. In the silent
room below, Ella wept bitterly and Aunt
Amelia waited to hear that the little soul was
gone. She waited calmly, declaring that she
had done her duty by the child up-stairs.</p>

<p>Marian lived. A few weeks more and Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Amelia heard her ringing laugh and knew
that she was happy. At last Marian was well
enough to leave her room but it was days and
days after the house was fumigated before she
was allowed to see Ella or sit at the table with
the family. Everything seemed changed.
The rooms were brighter and more cheerful.
The pictures on the walls had a different
meaning. The very chairs looked new.
Nothing appeared just as Marian left it.
Even Aunt Amelia was better looking and
spoke more kindly to the child. Nothing was
ever the same after Marian had diphtheria.
She never returned to the little back room
where she was away from all the family at
night, nor did she ever again doubt that Uncle
George was her own uncle.</p>

<p>Many bright days crowded one upon another
during the remaining weeks of winter.
The neighbors invited Marian to their homes
and took her driving with them. Dolly
Russel's mother gave a house party for her, inviting
little girls from the country for a week
in town. That was the time Marian was so
happy she almost believed herself a princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
in a fairy tale. When she was home again,
the child added a line to her diary.</p>

<p>"February 29.&mdash;I had diphtheria this
winter and it was a good thing. I got well
and now I am having the best time that ever
was written down in a diary. I have changed
my mind about being an author. I won't
have time to write books. There is too much
fun in the world."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="c">MUSICAL CONVERSATIONS</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> in a great while Marian and Ella had
a chance to play together. These rare occasions
were times of joy.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Claire usually took Ella with her
wherever she went, but sometimes she was
compelled to leave the child at home with her
father or Tilly, and there was merriment in
the house. The little cousins had gay times
and their only regret was that such hours of
happiness were few. At last Marian thought
of a plan. Her new room was opposite Ella's.
As Aunt Amelia insisted upon sending Marian
to bed at seven, Uncle George declared that
early hours were necessary for Ella's welfare.
Accordingly, both children went to their
rooms at the same time with instructions not
to talk. No one cautioned them not to sing
and singing was one of Marian's habits. After
listening to the solos a few nights, Ella tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
a song of her own and that gave Marian an
idea. She listened until Ella stopped for
breath and then expressed a few thoughts to
the tune of "Home, Sweet Home."</p>

<p>It was fun. The other lady took the hint
quickly. She and her children went to
the concert without waiting to get ready.
Furthermore she left herself sitting beside her
children in the best seat in the hall and at the
same time took her place on the stage. She
even went so far as to become a colored man
while she sang</p>

<p>Ella's mother came up-stairs for something
as the gentleman was rendering this selection
with deep feeling, but she had no idea that
her little daughter was singing on the stage,
nor did she know that the greatest soprano in
America was the next performer, although she
did hear Marian begin in tragic tones,
"'There is a happy land, far, far away.'"
"Far, far away" was tremulous with emotion.</p>

<p>From that hour dated many a concert, and
after the concerts, the ladies continued to sing
everything they had wished to talk over during
the day. Often the musical conversations
were cut short by an admonition from the
hall below, but even Tilly never learned the
nature of those evening songs. As the children
disturbed nobody and were put to bed
long before they were sleepy, Uncle George
said, "Let them sing." In this way Marian
and Ella became well acquainted.</p>

<p>One night Marian asked Ella if she knew
anything about how she happened to be taken
to the Little Pilgrim's Home when she was a
baby.</p>

<p>"What kind of a song are you singing?"
called Aunt Amelia.</p>

<p>"Opera house music," replied Marian, who
feared that concerts were over for the season
when she heard the question.</p>

<p>"I thought," responded Aunt Amelia,
"that a lunatic asylum was turned loose.
Don't let me hear another sound to-night."</p>

<p>The musicians laughed softly, and there
were no more solos that evening.</p>

<p>The following day Ella and Aunt Amelia
went visiting and in the middle of the forenoon,
when Tilly was busily working in the
kitchen, Marian climbed the attic stairs with
determination in her eye. An old portrait of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
George Washington on the wall at the landing
seemed to question her motives. "Don't
worry, Mr. Washington," remarked the child,
"I'm not going to tell a lie, but sir, I'm looking
for my mother and I'm going to find her
if she's here." Marian gazed steadily at the
face in the old oaken frame, and meeting with
no disapproval there, passed on, leaving the
Father of her Country to guard the stairway.</p>

<p>There were numerous trunks, boxes, barrels
and an old sea-chest in the attic. Marian
hesitated a moment before deciding to try the
yellow chest. Her knees shook as she lifted
the cover. At first she was disappointed;
there seemed to be nothing but blankets in
the chest. Then a bit of blue silk peeping
from beneath the blankets caught her eye and
Marian knew she was searching in the right
place. From the depths of the chest she drew
forth a bundle, unfolded it and beheld a beautiful
gown of pale blue silk, trimmed with
exquisite lace. Tears filled her eyes as she
touched the shimmering wonder. She had
never seen anything like it.</p>

<p>"This was my mother's," she whispered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
kissed the round neck as she held the waist
close in her arms. "She wore it once, my
mother." Marian would gladly have looked
at the dress longer but time was precious and
there was much to see. Embroidered gowns
of purest white, bright sashes and ribbons
were there, and many another dainty belonging
of the woman whose name was never
mentioned in the presence of her child. In a
carved ivory box, were jewels. Marian closed
it quickly, attracted by a bundle at the bottom
of the chest. She had found it at last. The
picture of her mother. It was in an oval
frame, wrapped in a shawl of white wool.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I had her, if she could only come
to me," cried Marian, as the lovely face became
her own. Though the child might
never again see the picture, yet would it be
ever before her.</p>

<p>When she dared stay in the attic no longer,
Marian kissed the picture, wrapped it in the
white shawl and laid it tenderly away. As
she did so she noticed for the first time a
folded newspaper on the bottom of the chest.
Inside the paper was a small photograph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Marian tiptoed to the attic stairs and listened
a moment before she looked at the photograph.
Then she uttered a low exclamation
of delight. There was no doubt that the face
in the oval frame was her mother's, for the
small picture was a photograph of Marian's
father and a beautiful woman. "It's the same
head," whispered the child, "and oh, how
pretty she is. I am so glad she is my mother!</p>

<p>"I wonder what they saved an old newspaper
so carefully for?" continued Marian.
"Maybe I had better look at it. What does
this mean? 'Claimed by Relatives,' who was
claimed, I wonder? Oh! I was! Now I'll
find out all I want to know because, only see
how much it tells!"</p>

<p>Marian laid the photograph down and read
the article from beginning to end. She didn't
see George Washington when she passed him
on the landing on the way down-stairs and
for the rest of the day the child was so quiet
every one in the house marveled. There were
no concerts that evening. The leading soprano
had too much on her mind. The following
morning Marian sharpened her lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
pencil and opened her diary. After looking
for a moment at the white page she closed the
book.</p>

<p>"No use writing down what you are sure to
remember," she remarked, "and besides that,
it is all too sad and finished. I am going outdoors
and have some fun." Marian was in the
back yard watching a cricket, when Ella sauntered
down the path singing, "Good-morning,
Merry Sunshine."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, sweetheart?" called
her mother from the kitchen window.</p>

<p>"Just down here by the fence to get some
myrtle leaves," Ella replied and went on singing.</p>

<p>Marian bent over the cricket nor did she
look up although Ella gave her surprising information
as she passed.</p>

<p>Marian smiled but dared not reply, especially

<p class="c">LITTLE SISTER TO THE DANDELION</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Marian</span> asked no questions the following
morning until she was on her way to the station
with Uncle George. "Where am I going?"
she finally ventured.</p>

<p>"Where you passed the summer last
year," was the reply. "How does that suit
you?"</p>

<p>"Suit me," repeated Marian, "nothing ever
suited me better. I'm pretty glad I'm going
there. Why didn't you send me back to
school, Uncle George? School won't be out
for two months. I'm glad you didn't, but
why?"</p>

<p>"Well, sis, you told me you wanted to go
to the country school."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now's your chance," interrupted the man,
"learn all you can and try to do some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
thing better than any one else in school, will
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, but Uncle George, big boys and big
girls go to country schools."</p>

<p>"What of it, Marian? You do some one
thing better than any one else in school, and
when you come home this fall you may
choose any book you wish at the book store,
and I will buy it for you."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle George, how will you know
whether I really do something better than
any one else or not?"</p>

<p>"I'll take your word for it, Marian."</p>

<p>"My word is true," the child remarked
with dignity.</p>

<p>"No doubt about it," added Uncle George,
turning away to hide a smile.</p>

<p>Just as the train pulled into the station,
Marian caught a glimpse of a small blue butter-fly.
It fluttered away out of sight as Uncle
George said "good-bye." "Oh, I hate to
leave that butter-fly," exclaimed Marian, and
those were the last words Uncle George heard
as he left her. The passengers smiled, but
Uncle George looked thoughtful. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
so much to be seen from the car windows and
so many folks to wonder about within the
car, the journey seemed short.</p>

<p>Two young ladies welcomed Marian at the
train, hugging and kissing her the minute
the small feet touched the platform. "I
guess folks will think you're some relation to
me," laughed the child.</p>

<p>"So we are," replied Miss Ruth Golding.
"We are your cousins."</p>

<p>"Certainly," agreed Miss Kate, "your
Uncle George knew us when we were little
girls, so of course we are your cousins."</p>

<p>"Of course!" echoed Marian, "and I
know my summer of happiness has begun
this day in April."</p>

<p>"Your troubles have begun, you mean,"
warned Miss Ruth; "the school-teacher
boards with us and you'll have to toe the
mark."</p>

<p>"Oh, goody!" exclaimed Marian. "I can
walk to school with her."</p>

<p>"You won't say 'goody' when you see the
lady," predicted Miss Kate. "She's as sober
as a judge, very quiet, and keeps to herself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter with her?" asked
Marian.</p>

<p>"She's lived in the city all her life and
eaten books," explained Ruth. "She eats
them, Marian, covers, binding, pictures and
everything. Too bad, but maybe you'll get
used to it. Here is mother coming to meet
you, and here comes Carlo."</p>

<p>Marian ran ahead to throw her arms
around Mrs. Golding's neck. "I am so glad
they sent me back to you," she cried. "I
didn't say anything about it to my aunt
because she would have sent me somewhere
else. It doesn't do to let her know when
you're too happy. She isn't a bit like you,
not a bit."</p>

<p>"No, I think not," was the response.
"You see, dear, your neighbor, Mrs. Russel,
is one of my old friends, and she has told
me so much about your aunt I feel as if I
know her. I am sure we are not alike."</p>

<p>"Why, I should say not!" laughed Marian.
"Why she's as thin as&mdash;as knitting
needles, and you're as plump as new pin
cushions. Won't we have fun this summer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
though? Well, Carlo, old fellow. Didn't
forget Marian, did he? Nice old doggie."</p>

<p>"Down, sir!" Mrs. Golding commanded.
"He is so glad to see you, Marian, he can't
express his feelings without trying to knock
you over."</p>

<p>"I wish Uncle George owned a dog," commented
Marian; "there'd always be some one
glad to see you when you got home. I like
dogs. Does the teacher come home at noon,
Mrs. Golding?"</p>

<p>"No, sometimes we don't see her until
supper time. She won't be such jolly company
for you as my girls. She's too quiet."</p>

<p>"Is she cross, Mrs. Golding?"</p>

<p>"No, oh, no indeed."</p>

<p>"Then I shall like her," was the quick
reply.</p>

<p>There were callers in the late afternoon, so
Marian wandered out alone. She had gone
but a short distance down the lane when she
saw dandelions ahead. She gathered a handful
of the short-stemmed blooms and walked
on. In the distance she heard a bluebird
singing. Marian ran to find it and was re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>warded
by a flash of glorious blue as the bird
sought a tree across the river. Marian followed
it as far as she could, being obliged to
stop at the river's bank. As she stood gazing
after the bird, she was startled by a woman's
voice.</p>

<p>"What have you in your hand, little girl?"</p>

<p>Turning, Marian saw a young lady sitting
on a log near by. "Just dandelions," the
child replied, and would have hidden the
bunch behind her if the young lady had not
forbidden it.</p>

<p>"We all love dandelions, little girl," she
said; "come and show them to me."</p>

<p>Marian wonderingly obeyed.</p>

<p>"Did you ever look at a dandelion through
a microscope?" continued the young lady.</p>

<p>"No, I never did."</p>

<p>The stranger passed Marian a microscope
and asked her to tell what she saw.</p>

<p>"Oh, I never knew a dandelion was like
this," said Marian; "why there are a thousand
little blossoms in it all crowded together,
and they are the goldenest golden ever was!
Oh, oh, oh! Wasn't it lucky you were here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
so I could see through your microscope?
What if I had never seen that dandelion!"</p>

<p>"Would you like to borrow the microscope
often?" asked the young lady, smiling so
pleasantly Marian straightway decided that
she was pretty.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say yes, Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;you
see I don't know what your name is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's so, I am Miss Smith, Miss Virginia
Smith. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"My name," was the reply, "is Marian Lee,
but who I am I don't really know."</p>

<p>Miss Smith repressed her curiosity, believing
that Marian was the little girl the Goldings
were to meet that day.</p>

<p>"It's everything to have a name," said she.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'd like some relatives," Marian
explained, "some real sisters and cousins and
aunts of my own."</p>

<p>"Why don't you do as Hiawatha did?"
Miss Smith suggested.</p>

<p>"You mean play all the birds and squirrels
are my brothers and sisters? I think I will.
I'll be little sister to the dandelion."</p>

<p>Miss Smith laughed with Marian. "I'll do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the same thing," said she, "and if we are sisters
to the dandelion, you must be my little
sister and I'm your big sister and all the wild
flowers belong to our family."</p>

<p>"It's a game," agreed Marian. "I suppose
little Indian children picked dandelions in
the spring-time before Columbus discovered
America."</p>

<p>"There were no dandelions then to pick,"
Miss Smith remonstrated. "The plant was
brought here by white men. Its name is
from the French, meaning lion's tooth."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything about a dandelion
to mean lion's tooth," objected Marian; "do
you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't, Marian, nor does any one
know exactly how it came by its name. Some
believe it was given to the plant because its
root is so white; then again, in the old days
lions were pictured with teeth yellow as dandelion
blossoms. The explanation I like best is
that the dandelion was named after the lion
because the lion is the animal that used to
represent the sun, and all flowers named after
him are flowers of the sun."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know anything more about dandelions?"
questioned Marian.</p>

<p>"If I don't," said Miss Virginia Smith,
smiling as she spoke, "it isn't because there
is nothing more to learn. Did you ever hear
the dandelion called the shepherd's clock?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Smith, never. Why should they
call it that?"</p>

<p>"Because the dandelion is said to open at
five and close at eight."</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Marian, "I guess you
could write a composition about dandelions."</p>

<p>"Possibly," was the laughing response.
"As far as that goes, Marian, there isn't a
thing that grows that hasn't a history if you
take the time and trouble to hunt it up."</p>

<p>"Skunk cabbages?" suggested Marian.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'skunk cabbages,'" was the reply.
"What flowers do you suppose are related
to it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, unless Jack-in-the-pulpit,
maybe, is it?"</p>

<p>"That's right, guess again."</p>

<p>"I'll have to give up, Miss Smith. I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
saw anything except Jack-in-the-pulpit that
looks a bit like old skunk cabbage."</p>

<p>"The calla lily, Marian, what do you think
of that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Miss Smith, but such things
happen, of course, because Winnie Raymond
has a horrible looking old Uncle Pete, and
Winnie's awful pretty herself. But how do
you know so much about plants?"</p>

<p>"By reading and observation, Marian."</p>

<p>"Are there many books about wild flowers,
Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>"More than we can ever read, little girl.
Better than that the country around this
village is a garden of wild flowers. Down by
the old mill and on the hills, in the fields and
woods and along the river bank, we shall
find treasures from now on every time we
take the shortest walk."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," grumbled Marian, "isn't it too
bad I've got to go to school?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you like to go to school,
child?"</p>

<p>"At home I do, on account of recesses. I
don't like the school part of it much, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
here it would be recess all the time if I could
go in the woods with you, besides having a
good time with the Golding girls and playing
all day long where I don't get scolded. Dear!
I wish I didn't have to go to school, or else I
wish they'd have lessons about birds and
flowers and butterflies and little animals, instead
of old arithmetic. I hate arithmetic."</p>

<p>"Do you?" sympathized Miss Smith.
"That's too bad, because we all need to understand
arithmetic."</p>

<p>"I don't," protested Marian. "I don't even
think arithmetic thoughts."</p>

<p>"Some day, Marian, you will wish you
understood arithmetic," said Miss Smith.
"Now if you and I went for a walk and we
saw ten crows, three song sparrows, five bluebirds,
seven chipping sparrows and twenty-seven
robins, and Mrs. Golding asked us
when we got home how many birds we saw,
I wonder how you would feel if you couldn't
add?"</p>

<p>"Well, but don't you see," interrupted
Marian, "I could add birds, yes and subtract
and multiply and divide them. That's dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>ferent.
What I don't like is just figures and
silly arithmetic things."</p>

<p>"Well, Marian, I may as well tell you now
that I'm the school-teacher and we'll have
arithmetic stories about birds and flowers and
little animals."</p>

<p>"Oh, are you the teacher?" exclaimed
Marian. "I thought she was&mdash;was&mdash;different,
you know."</p>

<p>"Different, how?"</p>

<p>"Well, they told me the teacher was&mdash;was
quiet."</p>

<p>"So she is, usually," agreed Miss Smith,
"but this afternoon she met one of her own
folks. This little sister to the dandelion."</p>

<p>"Won't we have fun!" was Marian's comment.</p>

<p class="c">PROFESSOR LEE, BOTANIST</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Virginia Smith</span> knew how to teach
arithmetic. Fractions lost their terror for
Marian, even the mysteries of cube root were
eagerly anticipated. History became more
than ever a living story to the child, and geography
was a never failing joy. On rainy
days every stream and puddle between Mrs.
Golding's home and the schoolhouse was
named, and if several Mississippi Rivers
emptied into Gulfs of Mexico, and if half a
dozen Niles overflowed their banks over the
country road, what difference did it make?
When the sun shone bright and only dew-drops
glistened in the shade, Marian saw
deserts and plains, mountains and volcanoes
along the dusty way.</p>

<p>For a time the game of geography became
so absorbing Marian played it at the table,
forming snowy peaks of mashed potatoes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
sprinkling salt upon the summits until the
drifts were so deep, only the valleys below
were fit to be eaten. Brown gravy was always
the Missouri River winding its way
across Marian's plate between banks of vegetables.
Ice cream meant Mammoth Cave. A
piece of pie was South Africa from which the
Cape of Good Hope quickly disappeared.
However hungry Marian might be, there was
a time when she ate nothing but continents
and islands.</p>

<p>Whatever Miss Virginia Smith tried to teach
the country children, Marian Lee appropriated
for herself. She listened to all recitations
whether of the chart class or the big
boys and girls. Perhaps if Marian had
attended more strictly to her own lessons, she
might have made the kind of a record she
thought would please Uncle George. As it
was, Jimmie Black "Left off head" in the
spelling class more times than she did, the first
month. Belle Newman had higher standings
in arithmetic and geography, and some one
carried off all the other honors.</p>

<p>Marian, however, knew something about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
botany before the end of May, and she
gloried in the fact that she could name all
the bones in her body. Mr. Golding was
proud of her accomplishment and once when
she went with him to see old Bess newly shod,
he asked her to name the bones for the blacksmith:
and the blacksmith thought it wonderful
that a little girl knew so much. "Yes,
but that's nothing," remarked the child, "all
the big boys and girls in the fifth reader class
know their bones."</p>

<p>"Ain't you in the fifth reader?" asked the
blacksmith.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, "I can read the whole
reader through, but I'm not in that reader
class. That's the highest class in the country.
I suppose being in the fifth reader here is like
being in the high school at home just before
you graduate. I won't have to learn bones
when I get up to the high school."</p>

<p>"And still you say that ain't nothing,"
protested the blacksmith.</p>

<p>Marian shook her head. "I haven't done
one thing in school better'n anybody else,"
she said, "and to do something better'n any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>body
else is all that counts. Don't you try to
be the best blacksmither in the country?"</p>

<p>Old Bess flourished her tail in the blacksmith's
face and the man spoke to her next instead
of to Marian. He wasn't the best blacksmith
and he knew it. Some years afterwards
when he had won an enviable reputation, he
told Mr. Golding that the first time he thought
of trying to do unusually good work was when
the little Lee girl asked him if he tried to be
the best blacksmith in the country.</p>

<p>Concerning botany, Miss Smith knew that
Marian was interested in the wild flowers and
had told her many a legend of wayside blooms
when walking with her through the fields and
across the hills: but she had no idea how much
the child had learned from listening to the recitations
of the botany class, until the Saturday
morning when the wax doll went to school.
Miss Smith happened to pass the corn-crib unnoticed
by teacher or pupil.</p>

<p>The doll was propped in an attitude of attention
among the ears of corn.</p>

<p>"Now, little girl," the instructor was saying,
"if you ever expect to amount to anything in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
this world, you've got to use your eyes and
ears. I'm the Professor of Botany your
mother was reading about last night, who
knew nothing about botany until she began
to study it. Next winter when we can't get
outdoors, I am going to give you lessons on
seeds and roots and things and stems and leaves.
The Professor of Botany has got to learn the
names of the shapes of leaves and how to
spell them. She really ought to own a book
but she doesn't, and that can't be helped.
You're sure to get what you want some time
though, if you only try hard enough, and the
Botany Professor will get a book. You just
wait.</p>

<p>"Don't think, little girl, because we are
skipping straight over to flowers this morning
that you are going to get out of learning beginnings.
We're taking flowers because it is
summer. Of course you know this is a strawberry
blossom I hold in my hand. Well, if it
wasn't for strawberry blossoms you couldn't
have strawberry shortcake, remember that.
That's the principal thing about strawberries.
This little circle of white leaves is called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
corolla. Now don't get the calyx mixed with
the corolla as some children do. I tell you it
makes me feel squirmy to hear some big girls
recite. You ought to see this flower under a
microscope. I guess I'll go and ask Professor
Smith for hers."</p>

<p>Marian turned around so quickly Professor
Smith was unable to get out of sight. The
doll's instructor felt pretty foolish for a
moment, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>"Marian Lee," said Miss Smith, "you shall
join the botany class next Monday morning
and I'll give you a book of mine to study."</p>

<p>"What will the big girls say?" gasped
Marian.</p>

<p>"About as much as your doll in there,"
laughed Miss Smith, adding seriously, "I
won't expect too much of you, Marian, but
you may as well be in the class and learn all
you can."</p>

<p>On Monday morning, although the big
girls smiled and the little girls stared, Professor
Lee became a member of the botany
class and learned to press the wild flowers.</p>

<p>"I won't have the most perfect lessons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
anybody in the class," Marian confided to her
doll, "because the big girls know so much;
but I'll try and have the best specimens in my
herbarium. I can do that, I am sure. I have
just got to do something better than any one
else in school before I go home."</p>

<p>The following Saturday the doll listened
with unchanging face to a confession. "Every
one of the big girls can press specimens better
than I can. Their violet plants look like
pictures but mine look like hay. I guess
Uncle George will be discouraged. I don't do
anything best. A robin is building a nest
just outside the window where my seat is in
school and I forgot to study my spelling lesson.
Of course I missed half the words. It
was the robin's fault. She ought to keep
away from school children."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="c">THE COMPOSITION ON WILD FLOWERS</p>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the children in Marian's class were
writing in their copy-books "Knowledge is
Power." The pens squeaked and scratched
and labored across pages lighted by June sunshine.
The little girls' fingers were sticky and
boy hands were cramped. It was monotonous
work. The "K" was hard to make and the
capital "P" was all flourishes.</p>

<p>Marian sighed, then raised her hand.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Miss Smith.</p>

<p>"Will you tell which one of us has the best
looking page when we get through with
'Knowledge is Power'?"</p>

<p>Miss Smith consented and Marian, determined
to conquer, grasped her pen firmly and
bent to the task. Two days later the page
was finished and seven copy-books were piled
upon Miss Smith's desk for inspection. At
first Miss Smith smiled as she examined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
various assertions that "Knowledge is Power,"
then she grew serious.</p>

<p>"Did you try your best, children?" she
asked, whereupon five girls and two boys
looked surprised and hurt.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I wonder what is the
trouble?" continued Miss Smith. "I am
ashamed of your work, children, it seems as
if you could do better."</p>

<p>"Which is best?" demanded Marian. It
made no difference how poor her copy was if
only it was better than the others. The child
was sorry she had asked the question when
she knew the truth. "I think it is pretty
discouraging," she said, "when you try your
best and do the worst."</p>

<p>"We will begin something new," Miss
Smith suggested. "Next week we will write
compositions on wild flowers and to the one
who does the neatest looking work, I will give
the little copy of 'Evangeline' I have been
reading to you. It will make no difference
whether the compositions are long or short,
but the penmanship must be good. Every
one of you knows the spring flowers for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
have had them here in school and have talked
about them every day."</p>

<p>"Will we have to write in our copy-books
just the same?" asked Tommy Perkins.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply; "you may work on
your compositions all the time we usually
write in the copy-books, and remember, it
doesn't make a bit of difference how short
your compositions are."</p>

<p>That was exactly what Marian did not remember.
At first she wrote:</p>

<p>"No flower is so pretty as the anemone that
blooms on the windy hill."</p>

<p>At recess she consulted Miss Smith. "Is
that long enough?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, that will do," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Is it fair if I copy off her composition?"
asked Tommy Perkins, "and practice writing
it? I can't make up one."</p>

<p>"That sentence will do as well as any
other," agreed Miss Smith. "I simply wish
you to write something you choose to do."</p>

<p>Marian beamed upon Tommy. "I'll copy
it for you," she said. "I don't really think
anemones are the prettiest flowers, Tommy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
but they are easy to write; no ups or downs
in the word if the flowers themselves do dance
like fairies all the day long."</p>

<p>"I wish't you'd write me a composition,"
put in Frankie Bean.</p>

<p>"I will," assented Marian, "after school
calls, but now, come on out and play."</p>

<p>After recess, Marian passed Frankie a piece
of paper upon which was written this:</p>

<p>"Clover loves a sunny home."</p>

<p>"That's easy, Frankie, because 'y' is the
only letter below the line. You can say sun-kissed
if you would rather keep it all above
the line. If I don't get the book, may be you
will. I hope you won't be disappointed,
though. I would try if I were you. Something
may happen to me before next week,
you never can tell."</p>

<p>Monday and Tuesday Marian wrote compositions
for the four girls to copy. They were
more particular than the boys had been and
their compositions were longer.</p>

<p>By the time Marian was ready to settle
down to her sentence on the anemone, she was
tired of it and determined to write something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
new. Soon she forgot all about penmanship
and Friday afternoon found her with a long
composition to copy in an hour. Even then,
after the first moment of dismay, she forgot
that neatness of work alone, would count.</p>

<p>Miss Virginia Smith read the composition
aloud.</p>


<p class="c">"<i>Wild Flowers, by Marian Lee.</i></p>

<p>"When you shut your eyes and think of
wild flowers, you always want to open them
and fly to the hills and the woods. You wish
you had wings like the birds.</p>

<p>"In an old flower legend book that tells
about things most folks don't know, I found
out what you were always sure of before you
knew it. The anemones are fairy blossoms.
The pink on the petals was painted by the
fairies and on rainy nights elves hide in the
dainty blooms.</p>

<p>"Tulips are not wild, but how can I leave
them out when the fairies used them for
cradles to rock their babies in.</p>

<p>"Some folks laugh at you when you hunt
for four-leaved clover, but you can never see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the fairies without one nor go to the fairy
kingdom.</p>

<p>"The old book says, too, that the bluebells
ring at midnight to call the fairies together.
I believe it because I have seen bluebells and
have almost heard the music. I don't believe
they ever were witches' thimbles.</p>

<p>"You most always get your feet wet when
you go after marsh marigolds, but it can't be
helped. They are yellow flowers and live
where they can hear the frogs all the time.
I wonder if they ever get tired of frog concerts.
I never do, only I think it is mournful
music after the sun goes down. It makes you
glad you are safe in the house.</p>

<p>"There is one lovely thing about another
yellow flower. It is the cinquefoil and you
find it before the violets come if you know
where to look. On rainy days and in damp
weather, the green leaves bend over and cover
the little yellow blossom. The cinquefoil
plant must be afraid its little darling will
catch cold.</p>

<p>"If you ever feel cross, the best thing you
can do is to go out where the wild flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
grow. You will be sure to hear birds sing
and you may see a rabbit or a squirrel. Anyway,
you will think thoughts that are not
cross."</p>

<p>"Evangeline" was given to Tommy Perkins.
He had practiced writing the anemone
sentence until his perfectly written words
astonished Miss Virginia Smith.</p>

<p>"I know my writing isn't good," admitted
a little girl named Marian. "Only see how
it goes up-hill and down-hill and how funny
the letters are."</p>

<p class="c">MARIAN'S LETTER HOME</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Marian's</span> letters to her Uncle George were
written on Sunday afternoons. She wrote
pages and pages about Miss Smith and the
country school and begged him not to come
for her in August.</p>

<p>"I haven't done anything better than any
one else in school yet," she wrote, "but I am
learning all kinds of things and having the
best time ever was. I want to go to the country
school until I graduate. I'll be ready for
college before you know it if you will only
let me stay.</p>

<p>"I am good all the time because Mrs. Golding
says so and Miss Ruth and Miss Kate
take me almost everywhere they go&mdash;when
they drive to town, circuses and things and I
have lovely times every day.</p>

<p>"I would tell you who I play with only
you would forget the names of so many chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>dren.
When I can't find any one else I go
to the mill to see the miller's boy. That isn't
much fun because the miller's boy is half foolish.
His clothes are always covered with
flour and he looks like a little old miller
himself. He jumps out at you when you
don't know where he is and says 'Boo!' and
scares you almost out of your wits, and that
makes his father laugh. I tried to teach him
to read but I didn't have good luck. He read
'I see the cat' out of almanacs and everything.</p>

<p>"The old miser died last night, Uncle
George, and I saw him in the afternoon.
Only think of it, I saw a man that died.
After dinner I went to see the miller's boy
and he wasn't there. His father said he was
wandering along the river bank somewhere,
so I stayed and talked to the miller. Pretty
soon the boy came back making crazy motions
with his arms and telling his father the
old miser wanted to see him quick.</p>

<p>"I went outside and watched the big wheel
of the mill when the boy and his father went
away, but it wasn't any time before the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
came back and said the old miser wanted to
see me. Of course I went as fast as I could
go, and when I got to the hut, the miller
asked me if I could say any Bible verses, and
if I could to say them quick because the old
miser wanted somebody to read the Bible
quick&mdash;quick. I thought it was queer, Uncle
George, but I was glad I had learned so much
out of the Bible.</p>

<p>"The old miser was all in rags and I guess
he didn't feel well then, because he was lying
down on a queer old couch and he didn't
stir, but I tell you he watched me. I didn't
want to go in the hut, so I stood in the doorway
where I could feel the sunshine all
around me. Some way I thought that wasn't
any time to ask questions, so I began the
Twenty-third Psalm right straight off. When
I got to the end of that I was going to say the
first fourteen verses of John, but the old miser
raised one hand and said, 'Again&mdash;again,' but
before I got any further than 'The valley of
the shadow,' he went to sleep looking at me
and I never saw his face so happy. It
smoothed all out and looked different. Poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
old miser, the boys used to plague him. The
miller motioned to his boy and me to go away.
I guess he was afraid Jakey would wake the old
miser. Of course I knew enough to keep still
when a tired looking old man dropped to
sleep.</p>

<p>"I don't know just when the old miser
died, Uncle George, nobody talks about it
where I can hear a word. Mrs. Golding says
when I grow up I will be glad that I could
repeat the Twenty-third Psalm to a poor old
man who hadn't any friends. She says it
isn't true that he was a miser, he was just an
unfortunate old man. I wonder if he was
anybody's grandfather? You never can tell.</p>

<p>"I am well acquainted with all the folks in
the village, Uncle George, and lots of times I
go calling. There are some old folks here
who never step outside of their houses and
they are glad to have callers. One old blind
woman knits all the time. She likes to be
read to, real well. And there is one woman,
the shoemaker's wife, that has six children
that bother her so when she tries to work; she
says it does her good to see me coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only think, Uncle George, how lonesome
I will be when I get home where I am not
acquainted. The only sad thing that has
happened here all summer is that the miser
died, and of course you know that might be
worse.</p>

<p>"I would like to be with Miss Smith more
than I am but she studies almost all the time.
I don't see what for because she knows everything,
even about the stars. She likes me a
great deal but I guess nobody knows it. You
mustn't have favorites when you are a school-teacher,
she told me so.</p>

<p>"You don't know how hard it is, Uncle
George, to do something better than anybody
else. You might think it would be easy, but
somebody always gets ahead of you in everything,
you can't even keep your desk the
cleanest. Some girls never bring in anything
from the woods, so of course they can keep
dusted.</p>

<p class="c">THE MOST TRUTHFUL CHILD IN SCHOOL</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the early morning the schoolhouse was
a quiet place, and there Miss Virginia Smith
went to study. No one knew why she
worked so hard, though Marian often wondered.
It was her delight to please Miss
Smith, and when the teacher waited several
mornings until a certain mail train passed
and the letters were distributed, Marian
offered to stop at the post-office and get the
mail.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you won't lose anything?"
asked Miss Smith.</p>

<p>"Sure," promised Marian. "You go to
school early as you used to do and I'll bring
your letters when I come."</p>

<p>Usually the postmaster gave Marian something
to carry to Miss Smith, and all went
well until a few days before school closed.
Elizabeth Gray called for Marian that morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ing
and together they went to the post-office
where they waited on tiptoe for the postmaster
to distribute the mail. There was one
letter for Miss Smith, a thin, insignificant
looking letter.</p>

<p>"That's nothing but an old advertisement,"
declared Elizabeth; "it wasn't worth waiting
for."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," agreed Marian,
"see what it says in the corner. What's a
seminary, anyway? Do you know?&mdash;'Young
Ladies' Seminary.' Some kind of a new
fashioned place to buy hats, may be, come
on."</p>

<p>"Yes, let's get started before the Prior kids
and the Perkinses catch up with us. I can't
bear that Tommy Perkins."</p>

<p>"We could play De Soto if we had a
crowd," suggested Marian. "You and I
could be the head leaders and the Priors and
the Perkins could be common soldiers."</p>

<p>"How do you play De Soto?" asked Elizabeth.
"I never heard of it."</p>

<p>"You've heard of De Soto, the man that
discovered the Mississippi River, I hope."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, he's in the history."</p>

<p>"Well, Elizabeth, I've been reading about
him in one of Mr. Golding's books about
early explorations and I knew in a minute
that it would be fun to play De Soto on our
way to school. Now, I'm De Soto."</p>

<p>"No, I'm going to be De Soto," insisted
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"You don't know how, Elizabeth Jane
Gray, and you didn't think of it first. All
right, though, you be De Soto if you want to.
What are you going to do? Begin."</p>

<p>"You always want to be the head one in
everything, Marian Lee. You needn't think
I'm Tommy Perkins!"</p>

<p>"I don't, Elizabeth, I think you're that
brave Spaniard Moscoso who was leader of
the soldiers after De Soto died and was buried
in the Mississippi River where the Indians
couldn't find him. But if you want to be
De Soto, go on, only I don't believe you
know a thing about him except what the history
says. Well, you're De Soto."</p>

<p>"You'll have to tell me what to do,
Marian."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess not, Miss Elizabeth, if you're
De Soto you ought to know."</p>

<p>Elizabeth walked on in silence for a few
moments until seized by an inspiration. "I'll
be De Soto to-morrow morning," she remarked;
"it's your turn first, of course, because you
thought of the game. I'm&mdash;who did you say
I am, Marian?"</p>

<p>"You're Moscoso, one of my officers, Elizabeth.
Well, I'm De Soto and I have had
wonderful adventures in my life. I was with
Pizarro in the conquest of Peru and I went
back to Spain rich, rich, rich. Now I am the
Governor of Cuba and Florida and not long
ago I had orders from Spain to explore
Florida. Of course, Moscoso, you remember
all about it, how we left Cuba with nine ships
and landed at Tampa?"</p>

<p>"I remember it, Soty, just as well as if it
was yesterday," and Moscoso, laughing merrily,
swung his dinner pail in a perfect circle.</p>

<p>"Don't laugh, Moscoso, at serious things,"
continued De Soto; "and I think you really
should call me Governor and I'll call you
General. Well, General, we sent most of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
ships back to Cuba, and now we're searching
for gold in Florida, not in our little State of
Florida, but the big, wide, long Florida that
used to be. Now, Elizabeth, we'll play wander
around for three years, living in Indian villages
winters and camping out summers and
having fights and discovering new birds to
write to Spain about and having all kinds of
adventures, until we get to that big ditch at
the four corners and that will have to be the
Mississippi River, and we'll cross it. We can
tie our handkerchiefs to sticks for banners.</p>

<p>"Let's play all the trees are Indians and all
the little low bushes are wild beasts. The
fences will do for mountains and I guess we'll
think of other things to play as we go along.
We'll have trouble with our soldiers, of course,
they always do when they are hunting for
gold. All these fields and woods, no, not
woods, forests, I mean, are what you call the
interior. Dandelions and buttercups will be
gold that we steal from the Indians. We'll
be awfully disappointed because this isn't a
gold country like Peru, but we will take all
there is, and I think we had better talk some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
about going home to Spain. Of course I don't
know I'm going to die of fever beyond the
Mississippi and you don't know you'll have
to go back to the coast without me. I wish
we could talk a little bit of real Spanish, don't
you, Elizabeth?"</p>

<p>"Hush," warned the General from Spain.
"I hear Indians. Let's play the wind in the
trees is Indian talk, Marian."</p>

<p>"Sure enough, Elizabeth, we must advance
cautiously, General Moscoso, they always 'advance
cautiously' in the books, or else 'beat a
hasty retreat.' We won't dare play retreat or
we'll never get to school. Oh, they're friendly
Indians, General, how fortunate."</p>

<p>De Soto had crossed the Mississippi when
he grew pale as death and suddenly deserted
his followers. The banners of Spain trailed
in the dust. "Elizabeth Jane Gray, where's
that letter?"</p>

<p>Two little girls gazed at each other in
dismay.</p>

<p>"Have you lost it?" gasped Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"If I haven't, where is it?" asked Marian.</p>

<p>"Can't you remember anything about it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Elizabeth went on, "when you had it last, or
anything?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't. Let's go straight back over
the road and hunt. I must have dropped it
and perhaps we may find it if we look. I
can't believe it is really lost. Oh, Elizabeth,
what shall I do if it is? I adore Miss Smith
and what will she think?"</p>

<p>"She won't think anything if you keep
still, Marian; the letter was only an old advertisement,
anyway."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, dear, dear!" wailed Marian.
"This is dreadful. I don't see a thing that
looks like a letter anywhere. I am going to
climb a tree and look way off over the
fields." Although the children searched
faithfully, they could not find the letter.</p>

<p>"We'll hunt at noon," suggested Elizabeth,
deeply touched by Marian's distress, "and
if I were you I wouldn't say a word about it."</p>

<p>"But Elizabeth, what if she asks me if
there was a letter?"</p>

<p>"Fib," was the response.</p>

<p>"It's enough to make anybody, Elizabeth."</p>

<p>"You'll be a goose, Marian, if you own up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
I won't tell on you and the letter didn't
amount to anything, anyway. Let's run for
all we're worth and get there before school
calls if we can. Sure's we're late she'll ask
questions."</p>

<p>Just as the bell was ringing, two breathless
little girls joined their schoolmates. Their
faces were flushed and their hair was tumbled.
Miss Smith smiled when she saw them, but
asked no questions. Noticing Marian's empty
hands, she said evidently to herself, "No letter
yet!"</p>

<p>"You're going to get out of this as easy's
pie, just keep your mouth shut," whispered
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"I shall have to tell," groaned Marian.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," Elizabeth advised.</p>

<p>During the morning exercises Marian determined
to confess no matter what happened.
When the chart class was called to the recitation
seat she raised her hand and was given
permission to speak to Miss Smith. Marian
didn't glance towards Elizabeth Gray as she
walked to the desk. Elizabeth had never
stolen cookies. "Miss Smith," said Marian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
"you had a letter this morning and I lost
it."</p>

<p>"You dear child, I am so glad you told
me," and Miss Smith who had so often insisted
that a school-teacher must never have
favorites, put her arms around the little girl
and kissed the soft, brown hair. "Now tell
me what was printed on the envelope if you
can remember."</p>

<p>Word for word Marian described the letter.</p>

<p>"It is the one I was expecting," said Miss
Smith, and while the chart class waited,
their teacher wrote a letter, stamped it and
sent it to the post-office by Tommy Perkins.</p>

<p>Two days later, Marian carried Miss Smith
a letter exactly like the one she had lost.
Miss Smith read it, smiled and asked Marian
to stay after school.</p>

<p>"You're going to get your scolding at last,"
predicted Elizabeth. "I told you not to
tell."</p>

<p>At four o'clock the children trooped out and
flew down the road like wild birds escaped
from a cage, leaving Marian uneasily twisting
her handkerchief while she waited for Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Smith to speak. Nothing was said until the
sound of childish voices came from a distance.
Then Miss Smith looked up and laughed.
"Can you keep a secret for a few days,
Marian?" she asked. "Come here, dear, and
read the letter you brought me this morning."</p>

<p>Marian read the short letter three times before
she asked, "Are you going?"</p>

<p>"Going," echoed Miss Smith; "that is the
position I have long wished for, Marian. Only
think how I shall enjoy teaching botany and
English in a boarding-school. You see what
they say, Marian, they want an immediate
reply or it will be too late. If you hadn't
told me about the letter you received the
other day, I should have lost the position. I
imagined what the letter was and sent for a
copy. If you hadn't told me the truth,
Marian, only think what a difference it would
have made!"</p>

<p>"I just have to tell the truth," said the little
girl.</p>

<p>"I believe you, dear, I never saw a more
truthful child in my life."</p>

<p>"Would you dare say I am the most honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
child in school?" asked Marian, a sudden
light making her face beautiful. "Will you
write it down and sign your name?"</p>

<p>"Well, you are the queerest mortal," exclaimed
Miss Smith, but reaching for a piece
of paper and a pen, she wrote this:</p>

<p>"Marian Lee is the most truthful pupil in
my school.</p>

<p class="sig">"<span class="smcap">Virginia Smith</span>, Teacher."</p>

<p>"It's for Uncle George," Marian explained.
"He told me to try to do something better
than anybody else and I haven't done it.
He's coming for me Saturday and please do
ask him to send me to your boarding-school.
He has often talked about sending me away
to school, but I used to be afraid to go and
made a dreadful fuss, and then I had diphtheria."</p>

<p>Uncle George arrived on Friday in time to
have a long talk with Miss Smith before she
left on the evening train. Had Marian
known the nature of their conversation, she
might not have cried so bitterly when the
hour of parting came.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="c">MORE CHANGES</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Marian</span> had been home a month when
Uncle George decided to send her to boarding-school.</p>

<p>"It is a curious thing," he remarked to the
child, "that other people find it so easy to get
along with you, and here at home there is no
peace in the house while you are in it."</p>

<p>The man's tones were savage and Marian
cried. Tears always angered Uncle George,
and when Uncle George was angry with
Marian, Aunt Amelia generally sighed and
straightway did her duty: and Aunt Amelia's
duty towards Marian consisted in giving a detailed
account of the child's faults and a history
of her sins. She never failed to mention
cookies. When Marian was wise, she kept
still. If she ventured a remonstrance serious
trouble was sure to follow. Out in the fresh
air and sunshine, the child managed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
happy in spite of everything: but within the
four walls of Aunt Amelia's home it took
courage to face life. She didn't know that
her uncle had written to Miss Virginia Smith.</p>

<p>"They're going to do something with you,
I don't know what," confided Ella. "I'll let
you know as soon's I find out." Ella was as
good as her word. "They're going to send
you to boarding-school," was her next secret
announcement, "but when or where, I don't
know."</p>

<p>One morning Marian went to her room after
breakfast and sat long by the open window,
wondering what would become of her and why
she had been taken from the Little Pilgrim's
Home by an aunt who didn't want her.
Tears splashed upon the window sill. Marian
wiped her eyes quickly. Young as she was,
the child realized how dangerous it is to be
sorry for oneself. Without a backward
glance, Marian walked from the room and
closed the door she was never to open again.
When she came home from school that night,
the child played in the orchard until supper-time.
Then she wondered why Aunt Amelia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
didn't send her to her room. An hour passed
before the woman looked at the clock and
spoke. Instead of the words Marian expected
to hear, Aunt Amelia said calmly:</p>

<p>"Your trunk is packed and the carriage is
waiting to take you to the station. Get your
coat and hat."</p>

<p>"Where am I going and who is going with
me?" demanded the child, beginning to
tremble so she could scarcely stand.</p>

<p>"I shall accompany you," replied Aunt
Amelia, "and it makes no difference where
you are going. You will know soon
enough."</p>

<p>Marian shot a grateful look towards Ella,
who was sobbing in a corner. But for the little
cousin's assurance, Marian would have believed
she was about to start for the long
dreaded reform school. Nevertheless it was a
shocking thing to be suddenly torn from every
familiar sight and to be going so blindly into
the unknown. Marian looked appealingly at
Aunt Amelia and Uncle George before she
broke down and cried. Aunt Amelia's face
was stony, Uncle George looked cross and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>noyed.
Marian's grief became wild and despairing.</p>

<p>"I wish I could have my mother's picture
to take with me," she sobbed, "I wish I
could."</p>

<p>"That's a reasonable request and you shall
have it," said Uncle George.</p>

<p>"It will be time enough when she is older,"
Aunt Amelia put in, while Marian held her
breath. Would she get the picture or not?
A word might ruin her chances, so she kept
still, trying hard to smother her sobs.</p>

<p>"Are you going for the picture or shall I?"
demanded Uncle George. Aunt Amelia went.</p>

<p>Marian was disappointed when she saw the
small photograph of her father and mother.
She wished for the face in the oval frame.
She would have been more disappointed had
she never seen the photograph, because instead
of giving it to the child or allowing her
to look at the picture, Aunt Amelia wrapped
it in a piece of paper and put it in her own
satchel.</p>

<p>Outside in the cool, silent night, Marian
stopped crying. There was comfort in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
steadily shining stars. During the first long
hours on the sleeping car, Marian tossed,
tumbled and wondered where she was going.
Asleep she dreamed of reform school: awake
she feared dreams might come true. When
trains rushed by in the darkness the child was
frightened and shivered at the thought of
wrecks. At last she raised her curtain and
watched the stars. Repeating over and over
one verse of the poem she had recited the last
day of school in the country, she fell peacefully
asleep. There were no more troubled
dreams nor startled awakenings. When
Marian opened her eyes in the morning, the
verse still haunted her memory.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="c">MARIAN REMEMBERS HER DIARY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">"October</span> 15.&mdash;You might as well keep a
diary, especially in a school where they have
a silent hour. It is the queerest thing I ever
heard of but every night between seven and
eight it is so still in this building you don't
dare sneeze. It isn't so bad when you have a
roommate because then you have to divide the
hour with her. You stay alone half and then
you go to the reading-room or the library and
read something and try not to whisper to any
of the girls, while your roommate stays alone
her half of the hour.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the reason I don't like silent hour
is because I used to have so many of them at
home and now because I haven't any roommate
I have to stay alone the whole hour. I
don't know what to do with myself and that
is why I am going to keep a diary again.</p>

<p>"There is a good reason why I haven't any
roommate. When my aunt brought me here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the principal said they were expecting a little
girl just my age and they were going to put
her in this room with me. It isn't much fun
to be a new girl in this kind of a school, especially
when most everybody is older than you
are. When the girls saw my aunt they stared,
and they stared at me, too. It wasn't very
nice and I felt uncomfortable. As long as my
aunt stayed I didn't get acquainted. I didn't
even dare say much to Miss Smith. I just
moped around and wished I was out in the
country with the happy Goldings. They said
here, 'Poor little thing, she's homesick,' but I
am sure I wasn't if that means I wanted to go
back home. My aunt stayed two days and one
night. She said she was waiting to see my
roommate but at last she gave up and went
home and then I felt different. I began to
wonder what kind of a girl my roommate
would be and when she came I was so happy
I could scarcely breathe because she was Dolly
Russel. We thought we were going to have
such a good time, and we did for a few days
until I was a big goose. I wrote home and
told my aunt who my roommate was and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
ended it. Aunt Amelia wrote to the principal
and she wrote to me, and then Dolly went to
room with an old girl eighteen years old, from
Kansas.</p>

<p>"Dolly says her new roommate is nice, but
she's too old and besides that she's engaged.
Dolly told me all about it.</p>

<p>"My aunt wouldn't let me room with Dolly
because she said we would play all the time
instead of studying our lessons. I guess she
was afraid we would have a little fun. She
told me in a letter that if she had known
Dolly Russel was coming to this school she
would have sent me somewhere else or kept
me at home, no matter what Uncle George
and Miss Smith said. I know why. Dolly
has told the Kansas girl and some others
about my aunt already, how cross she is and
such things. I don't mind now what anybody
says about Aunt Amelia since I have
found out that she isn't any relation to me.
She is just my aunt by marriage and you
can't expect aunts by marriage to love you,
and if your aunt doesn't love you, what's the
use of loving your aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I hadn't passed the entrance examinations
here I couldn't have stayed. Dolly and
a girl whose name is Janey somebody and I
are the only little girls here. Janey is tall
and wears her hair in a long, black braid.
Mine's Dutch cut. Dolly Russel's is Dutch
cut too. Janey calls us little kids and she
tags around after the big girls. We don't
care.</p>

<p>"October 16.&mdash;There's another girl coming
from way out west. Her folks are going to
be in Chicago this winter and they want her
in this school. The Kansas girl told Dolly
and me.</p>

<p>"October 17.&mdash;The new girl has come and
they have put her with me. She's homesick.
Her father brought her and then went right
away. I didn't see him. I think I shall
like the new girl. Her name is Florence
Weston and she has more clothes than the
Queen of Sheba. Miss Smith helped her unpack
and I felt as if I would sink through
to China when the new girl looked in our
closet. It is a big closet and the hooks were
nearly all empty because I haven't anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
much to hang up. I'll never forget how I
felt when the new girl said to me, 'Where are
your dresses?' Before I could think of anything
to say, Miss Smith sent me for the
tack hammer and I didn't have to answer.</p>

<p>"My room looked pretty lonesome after
Dolly moved out, but now it is the nicest
room in school because Florence Weston has
so many beautiful things. She says this is
horrid and I just ought to see her room at
home. She can't talk about her home without
crying. I know I'd cry if I had to go
back to mine.</p>

<p>"October 20.&mdash;That Janey is a queer girl.
She won't look at me and I really think it is
because I haven't any pretty dresses. She is
in our room half the time, too, visiting with
Florence. They are great chums and they
lock arms and tell secrets and laugh and talk
about what they are going to do next summer
and where they are going Christmas and
everything. I wish more than ever that I
had Dolly for my roommate. I wouldn't be
surprised if her father is richer'n Florence
Weston's father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"That Janey puts on airs. Her last name
is Hopkins. She signs her name 'Janey C.
Hopkins.' She never leaves out the 'C,' I
wonder why.</p>

<p>"October 21.&mdash;I like Florence Weston.
She is not a bit like that proud Janey.</p>

<p>"November 1.&mdash;Sometimes I wish I had
never come here to school. Once in a while
I feel more lonesome, almost&mdash;than I ever
did at home. It is on account of that
Janey C. Hopkins. She wants to room with
Florence and she tried to get me to say I
would move in with Laura Jones, the girl she
rooms with. Janey says she's going to the
principal. Let her go. Miss Smith told me
not to worry, they won't let chums like
Florence and Janey room together because
they won't study.</p>

<p>"November 2.&mdash;What did I tell you? I
knew she'd be sorry. They won't let Janey
room with Florence. Florence says she's
glad of it. I suppose it is on account of
hooks. Janey couldn't let her have more
than half the hooks in the closet.</p>

<p>"November 3.&mdash;It wasn't on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
hooks. Florence told me one of Janey's
secrets and I know now what the 'C' means
in Janey's name and I know who Janey C.
Hopkins is, and I should think she would remember
me, but she doesn't. Janey told
Florence that she is adopted and that her
new mother took her from the Little Pilgrims'
home before they moved out to Minnesota.
I was so surprised I almost told
Florence I came from that same home, but I
am glad I didn't.</p>

<p>"The only reason Florence doesn't want to
room with Janey is because she lived in an
orphan's home. She says you never can tell
about adopted children and that maybe
Janey's folks weren't nice, and anyway, that
if she ever lived in an orphan's home she
would keep still about it.</p>

<p>"I think I shall keep still, but I could tell
Miss Florence Weston one thing, my folks
were nice if they did die. I could tell her
what I read in that newspaper in the sea-chest,
how my father just would go to South
America with some men to make his fortune
and how after a while my mother thought he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
was dead and then she died suddenly and all
about how I happened to be taken to the
Little Pilgrims' Home in the strange city
where my mother and I didn't know anybody
and nobody knew us.</p>

<p>"I could tell Florence Weston I guess that
my father left my mother plenty of money
and she wasn't poor, and after she died the
folks she boarded with stole it all and pretty
near everything she had and then packed up
and went away and left me crying in the
flat, and it just happened that some folks
on the next floor knew what my name was
and a few little things my mother told
them.</p>

<p>"I won't speak of the Little Pilgrims'
Home, though, because I can't forget how Uncle
George acted about it. It was a pleasant,
happy home just the same, and when I grow
up and can do what I want to I am going
back and hunt for Mrs. Moore and I won't
stop until I find her. I have missed her all
my life. You can't help wondering why some
mothers live and some mothers die, and why
some children grow up in their own homes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
and other children don't have anybody to
love them.</p>

<p>"November 4.&mdash;Sunday. The queer things
don't all happen in books. I am glad I have
a diary to put things in that I don't want to
tell Miss Smith nor Dolly. Just before dark
I was in the back parlor with a lot of girls
singing. When we were tired of singing we
told stories about our first troubles. I kept
still for once, I really couldn't think what my
first one was anyway. Two or three girls said
that when their mothers died, that was their
first sorrow, but Florence Weston said that
her first one was funny. She couldn't remember
when her own father died so she
can't count that. The father she has now is
a step one.</p>

<p>"Florence says she was a little bit of a girl
when her mother took her one day to visit an
orphan's home and she cried because she
couldn't stay and have dinner with the little
orphans. She says she remembers that one
of the little girls wanted to go home with her
and her mother and when she cried that little
orphan girl cried too. They all laughed when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Florence told her story, all but me. I knew
then what my first sorrow was. What would
Florence think if she knew I was that little
orphan? I must never tell her though or she
wouldn't room with me. I should think
Florence would be the happiest girl in the
world. I should be if I had her mother. I
can see her now if I shut my eyes. Her
hair was shining gold and her eyes were like
the sky when the orchard is full of apple
blossoms.</p>

<p>"November 25.&mdash;Florence has gone to
Chicago to stay until Monday morning because
to-morrow is Thanksgiving day and her
folks wanted to see her. Florence has two
baby brothers and one little sister.</p>

<p>"Dolly Russel's father and mother have
come here to be with Dolly to-morrow and
they have invited me to have dinner with
them down town. I wonder what Aunt
Amelia would say if she knew I am going to
be with the Russels all day to-morrow. Miss
Smith got permission for me to go, she knew
what to say to the principal, and she kissed
me too, right before Mrs. Russel. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
already beginning to dread going home next
June.</p>

<p>"Janey C. Hopkins is going home this
afternoon and the Kansas girl is going with
her. There will be ten girls all alone in the
big dining-room here to-morrow. I guess
they will feel queer. I know one thing, I
would rather stay here with nobody but the
matron Christmas, than to go home, and I am
glad Aunt Amelia says it would be foolish for
any one to take such a long journey so I could
be home for the holidays.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Russel is going to dress me all up to-morrow
in one of Dolly's prettiest dresses. I
do have some streaks of luck."</p>

<p class="c">FLORENCE WESTON'S MOTHER</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Marian</span> was studying Monday morning
when Florence returned from Chicago. She
burst into the room like a wind blown rose,
even forgetting to close the door until she had
hugged Marian and hugged her again.</p>

<p>"Now shut your eyes tight," she commanded,
"and don't you open them until I
tell you to. You remember when you asked
me if I had a picture of my mother and I said I
hadn't anything only common photographs?
well, you just wait."</p>

<p>Marian closed her eyes while Florence
dived into her satchel for a small package.</p>

<p>"I have something in a little red leather
case that will make you stare, Marian dear,
you just wait."</p>

<p>"Well, I am waiting," was the retort,
"with my eyes shut so tight I can see purple
and crimson spots by the million. Hurry up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
why don't you? Is it a watch with your
mother's picture in it?"</p>

<p>"No, guess again."</p>

<p>"A locket?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, no. It is something&mdash;three
somethings that cost forty times as much as a
watch or locket. Now open your eyes and
look on the bureau."</p>

<p>"Why don't you say something?" questioned
Florence, as Marian stood speechless
before three miniatures in gold frames.
"That's my mother and our baby in the
middle frame, and the girl on this side is my
little sister and the boy in the other frame we
call brother, just brother, since the baby
came. Why Marian Lee! I never thought
of it before, but you look like brother just as
sure as the world!</p>

<p>"Why, Marian! what's the matter, what
makes you cry when you look at mamma's
picture?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Florence, only I want a mother
myself, I always wanted one."</p>

<p>"You poor young one!" exclaimed Flor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>ence,
"it must be dreadful not to have a
mother."</p>

<p>"It's like the Desert of Sahara!" Marian
declared, dashing the tears from her eyes and
making an attempt to smile. "You will see
your mother again soon."</p>

<p>"I know it, Marian, only think, three
weeks more and then the holidays. Are you
going home Wednesday night or Thursday
morning?"</p>

<p>"I am not going home until June," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"Can you stand it as long as that, Marian?"</p>

<p>The mere thought of feeling badly about
not being home for the holidays made the
child laugh.</p>

<p>"You are the queerest girl," exclaimed
Florence, "you cry when I don't see anything
to cry about and you laugh when I should
think you would cry."</p>

<p>Marian checked an impulse to explain.
How could Florence understand? Florence,
whose beautiful mother smiled from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
round, gold frame, the girl whose sister
and brothers waited to welcome her
home.</p>

<p>"If they were mine," said Marian, gazing
wistfully at the miniatures, "I would never
leave them. I would rather be a dunce than
go away to school."</p>

<p>"Then my father wouldn't own you," said
Florence, laughing. "Mamma says she's
afraid he wouldn't have any patience if I disgraced
him in school. You ought to belong
to him, Marian, he would be proud of you.
You know your lessons almost without studying
and you have higher standings than the
big girls. You've been highest in all your
classes so far, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "except in geometry,
but what of it? Nobody cares."</p>

<p>"Don't your folks at home? Aren't they
proud of you?"</p>

<p>"I used to hope they would be, Florence;
but I tell you, nobody cares."</p>

<p>"Well, haven't you any grandfathers or
grandmothers or other aunts or uncles?"</p>

<p>"I am not acquainted with them," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Marian. "My uncle hasn't any folks, only
distant cousins."</p>

<p>"That's just like my father," Florence interrupted.
"His folks are all dead, though I
have heard him mention one half brother with
whom he wasn't friends. Mamma won't let
me ask any questions about him. But,
Marian, where are your mother's folks?"</p>

<p>Where were they, indeed? Marian had
never thought of them. "Well, you see," the
child hastily suggested, "they don't live near
us."</p>

<p>The next time Florence saw Dolly Russel,
she asked some questions that were gladly
answered. "Go home!" exclaimed Dolly,
"I shouldn't think she would want to go
home! You see the St. Claires live right
across the street from us and I have seen
things with my own eyes that would astonish
you. Besides that, a girl that used to work
for the St. Claires, her name is Lala, works for
us now, and if she didn't tell things that
would make your eyes pop out of your head!
Shall I tell you how they used to treat that
poor little Marian? She's the dearest young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
one, too&mdash;Lala says so&mdash;only mamma has always
told me that it's wretched taste to listen
to folks like Lala."</p>

<p>"Yes, do tell me," insisted Florence, and by
the time Dolly Russel had told all she knew,
Florence Weston was in a high state of indignation.</p>

<p>"Oh, her uncle and her little cousin are all
right," remonstrated Dolly; "they are not
like the aunt."</p>

<p>"I know what I shall do," cried Florence.
"Oh, I know! I shall tell mamma all about
Marian and ask if I may invite her to Chicago
for the holidays. She would have one good
time, I tell you. I like Marian anyway, she
is just as sweet as she can be. I should be
miserable if I were in her place, but she sings
all the day long. My little sister would love
her and so would brother and the baby. I
am going straight to my room and write the
letter this minute."</p>

<p>"Mrs. St. Claire won't let Marian go,"
warned Dolly; "you just wait and see. She
doesn't want Marian to have one speck of
fun."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless Florence Weston wrote the
letter to her mother and in due time came
the expected invitation. At first Marian was
too overjoyed for words: then she thought of
Aunt Amelia and hope left her countenance.
"I know what I will do," she said at last,
"I will ask Miss Smith to write to Uncle
George. Maybe then he will let me go. Nobody
knows how much I want to see your
mother."</p>

<p>Florence laughed. "I think I do," she said.
"I have told my mother how you worship
her miniature. I shouldn't be surprised to
come in some day and find you on your
knees before it. My mother is pretty and
she is lovely and kind, but I don't see how
anybody could care so much for her picture.
Most of the girls just rave over brother, but
you don't look at him. Just wait until you
see him, Marian. I'll teach him to call you
sister. He says 'Ta' for sister."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish you would," said Marian, "I
love babies and I never was anybody's sister
of course. He is just as cunning as he can
be. I am going now to ask Miss Smith to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
write to Uncle George. She can get him to
say yes if anybody can."</p>

<p>Miss Smith wrote and rewrote the letter,
then waited for an answer with even less patience
than Marian. At last it came, in Aunt
Amelia's handwriting. Marian's heart sank
when she saw the envelope. Her fears were
well founded. Aunt Amelia was surprised
to find that Marian knew no better than to
trouble Miss Smith as she had. She might
have known that Uncle George would not
approve of her going to a city the size of
Chicago to pass the holidays with strangers.
Miss Smith, Dolly and Florence were indignant.
Even Janey did some unselfish sputtering.</p>

<p>"Anything's better than going home," Marian
reasoned at last, "and what's the use of
crying about what you can't help. I ought
to be glad it isn't June."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the holidays passed
pleasantly for Marian in the big deserted
house. The matron and the teachers who
were left did everything in their power to
please the child, and on Christmas Day the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
postman left her more gifts than she had ever
received before. There were no potatoes in
her stocking that year. During the holidays,
Marian kept the photograph of her own mother
beside the miniatures, and as the days went
by she became convinced that her mother
and Florence Weston's mother looked much
alike.</p>

<p>"My mother is prettier," she said aloud the
last day of the old year, "but she is dead and
as long as I live I never can see her. Perhaps
I may see this other mother and perhaps
she may love me. I shall have to put my
picture away because it will get faded and
spoiled, and I think I will pretend that
Florence Weston's mother is my mother.
Then I won't feel so lonesome. I never
thought of pretending to have a mother before."</p>

<p>When Florence returned after the holidays,
she was unable to account for the change in
Marian. The child was radiantly happy.
Tears no longer filled her eyes when she
gazed too intently upon the miniatures. Instead,
she smiled back at the faces and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>times
waved her hand to them when she left
the room. How could Florence dream that
Marian had taken the little brothers, the sister
and the mother for her own.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="c">HOW MARIAN CROSSED THE RAINBOW BRIDGE</p>


<p><span class="smcap">June</span> sent her messengers early. Every
blade of grass that pushed its way through
the brown earth, every bursting lilac bud or
ambitious maple, spoke to Marian of June.
Returning birds warbled the story and the
world rejoiced. Teachers and pupils alike
talked of June until it seemed to Marian that
all nature and educational institutions had
but one object, and that was to welcome June.
She dreaded it. June meant Aunt Amelia
and the end of all happiness. Yet Marian
was only one. Ninety-nine other girls were
looking eagerly forward to the close of school.
They talked of it everywhere and at all
hours.</p>

<p>It was the one subject of conversation in
which Marian had no share, one joy beyond
her grasp. Try hard as she would, Marian
couldn't pretend to be glad she was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
home. That was a game for which she felt
no enthusiasm. The mother, the little sister
and the baby brothers in the golden frames
would soon be gone, and gone forever. "We're
all going back West just as soon as school
closes," Florence had told her. "Next winter
we will be home."</p>

<p>Nor was that all that Florence told Marian.
She pictured the beautiful home in the West
in the midst of her father's broad lands. She
described her room, all sunshine and comfort,
and the great house echoing with music and
laughter. She told Marian of the gardens and
the stables, of the horses, ponies and many
pets. She described the river and the hills
and the mountain peaks beyond. Florence
almost forgot the presence of her wide eyed
roommate in telling of the holiday celebrations
at home and of the wondrous glory of
the annual Christmas tree. Best of all, Florence
spoke tenderly of her mother and her
voice grew tender in speaking of the woman
who never scolded but was always gentle and
kind; the beautiful mother with the bright,
gold hair. Florence had so much to say about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the little sister, brother and the baby, that
Marian felt as if she knew them all.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Florence Weston was going
home and Marian Lee was returning to
Aunt Amelia. Miss Smith understood all
about it and it grieved her. She had seen
Aunt Amelia and that was enough. She
didn't wonder that Marian's eyes grew sad and
wistful as the days lengthened. At last Miss
Virginia Smith thought of a way to win smiles
from Marian. The botany class had been offered
a prize. A railroad president, interested
in the school had promised ten dollars in gold
to the member of the botany class who made
the best herbarium. Marian might not win
the prize, but it would give her pleasure to
try. She would have something more agreeable
to think of than Aunt Amelia.</p>

<p>It was with some difficulty that Miss Smith
obtained permission from the principal for
Marian to enter the class, and but for the experience
in the country school, the objection
that Marian was too young would have barred
her out. Miss Smith was right. Marian was
delighted and for hours at a time Aunt Amelia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
vanished from her thoughts. The members
of the botany class were surprised that such a
little girl learned hard lessons so easily, but
Miss Smith only laughed.</p>

<p>In the beginning when the spring flowers
came and every wayside bloom suggested a
specimen, fully half the class intended to win
the prize, Marian among the number. One
by one the contestants dropped out as the
weeks passed, leaving Marian with perhaps
half a dozen rivals. At that early day, Miss
Virginia Smith, who had no favorites, rejoiced
secretly in the belief that Marian would win
the prize. The commonest weed became
beautiful beneath her hands and the number
of specimens she found on the school grounds
alone, exceeded all previous records. There
was never so much as a leaf carelessly pressed
among Marian's specimens. At last the child
began to believe the prize would be hers and
for the first time, going home lost its terrors.</p>

<p>If she won the prize, Uncle George would
be proud of her and she would be happy.
Finally Marian wrote to her uncle, telling
him of the glories of commencement week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
She was to recite "The Witch's Daughter" at
the entertainment, to take part in the operetta
and to sing commencement morning with
three other little girls. More than that, she
was sure to win the prize, even her rivals admitted
it. "Now Uncle George," the letter
proceeded, "please be sure and come because
I want somebody that is my relation to be
here. Florence Weston says her father would
come from Honolulu to see her win a prize, so
please come, Uncle George, or maybe Florence
will think nobody cares for me."</p>

<p>Marian was scarcely prepared to receive the
answer that came to her letter from Aunt
Amelia. Uncle George was too busy a man
to take so long a journey for nothing. Aunt
Amelia would come the day after commencement
and pack Marian's trunk. So far as
winning the prize was concerned, Uncle George
expected Marian to win a prize if one were
offered. That was a small way to show her
gratitude for all that had been done for her.
The child lost the letter. Janey C. Hopkins
found and read it. Before sunset every one
of the ninety-nine knew the contents. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
night settled down upon the school, one hundred
girls were thinking of Aunt Amelia, one
in tears, the ninety-nine with indignation.</p>

<p>The following morning Marian replied to
her aunt's letter, begging to be allowed to go
home with Dolly Russel and her mother, and
assuring Aunt Amelia that she could pack her
own trunk. Even that request was denied.
Aunt Amelia would call for Marian the day
after commencement and she wished to hear
nothing further on the subject. She might
have heard more had she not been beyond
sound of the ninety-nine voices. Marian was
too crushed for words. That is, she was
crushed for a day. Her spirits revived as
commencement week drew near and Miss
Smith and the ninety-nine did so much to
make her forget everything unpleasant. Marian
couldn't understand why the girls were
so kind nor why Janey C. Hopkins took a
sudden interest in her happiness. The Sunday
before commencement Marian wore
Janey's prettiest gown to church. It was
rather large for Marian but neither she nor
Janey found that an objection. Miss Smith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
approved and Sunday was a bright day for
Aunt Amelia's little niece.</p>

<p>Monday, Dolly Russel's mother came and
thanks to her, Marian appeared in no more
garments that had disgraced the hooks in her
closet. She danced through the halls in the
daintiest of Dolly's belongings, and was happy
as Mrs. Russel wished her to be.</p>

<p>Every hour brought new guests and in
the excitement of meeting nearly all the
friends of the ninety-nine and being kissed
and petted by ever so many mothers, Marian
forgot Aunt Amelia. Tuesday evening at the
entertainment she did her part well and was
so enthusiastically applauded, her cheeks grew
red as the sash she wore, and that is saying a
great deal, as Dolly's sash was a bright scarlet,
the envy of the ninety-nine.</p>

<p>Florence Weston's father and mother were
present at the entertainment, but Marian
looked for them in vain. "They saw you
just the same," Florence insisted when she
and Marian were undressing that night, "and
mamma said if it hadn't been so late she
would have come up to our room to-night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
but she thought they had better get back to
the hotel and you and I must settle down as
quickly as we can. I can hardly keep my eyes
open." Florence fell asleep with a smile
upon her face. Marian's pillow was wet with
tears before she drifted into troubled dreams
of Aunt Amelia.</p>

<p>"Isn't it too bad!" exclaimed Florence the
next morning. "They are going to present
the prize in the dining-room at breakfast and
my father and mother won't be up here until
time for the exercises in the chapel. I wanted
them to see you get the prize. I'm so disappointed.
Never mind, though, you will see
mamma all the afternoon, because she is going
to pack my things. We leave to-morrow. I
am going down-town with papa and mamma
when we get through packing and stay all
night. You will have the room all to yourself.
What? are you crying, Marian? Why,
I'll come back in the morning and see you
before I go. I wouldn't cry if I were you!"</p>

<p>It was easy enough for a girl who had every
earthly blessing to talk cheerfully to a weary
little pilgrim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>Marian experienced the bitterest moment
of her life when the prize was presented in
the dining-room. There were many fathers
and mothers there, and other relatives of the
ninety-nine who joined in cheering the little
victor. Yet Marian wept and would not be
comforted. Even Miss Smith had no influence.
In spite of the sympathetic arms that
gathered her in, Marian felt utterly forsaken.
She had won the prize, but what could it
mean to a motherless, fatherless, almost
homeless child? After breakfast, Marian, slipping
away from Miss Smith and the friendly
strangers, sought a deserted music room on
the fourth floor where she cried until her courage
returned: until hope banished tears. Perhaps
Uncle George would be pleased after all.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" demanded Florence
when Marian returned to her room. "I
have hunted for you everywhere. What a
little goose you were to cry in the dining-room.
Why, your eyes are red yet."</p>

<p>The only answer was a laugh as Marian
bathed her tear-stained face.</p>

<p>"I want you to look pretty when mamma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
sees you," continued Florence, "so don't you
dare be silly again."</p>

<p>In spite of the warning, Marian was obliged
to seek the obscurity of the fourth floor music
room later in the day, before she thought of
another refuge&mdash;Miss Smith's room. The
sight of so many happy girls with their mothers
was more than she could endure and Miss
Smith understood. Even the thought of
seeing Florence Weston's mother was a
troubled one, for alas! she couldn't beg to go
with the woman as she once did in the Little
Pilgrims' Home.</p>

<p>When the child was sure that Florence and
her mother were gone and while Miss Smith
was busy in the office, she returned to her
room. "The trunks are here yet," observed
Marian, "but may be they won't send for
them until morning," and utterly worn out
by the day's excitement, the child threw herself
upon the bed and sobbed in an abandonment
of grief.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the door was opened by
a woman who closed it softly when she saw
Marian. "Poor little dear," she whispered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
and bending over the sleeping child, kissed
her. Marian was dreaming of her mother.</p>

<p>"Poor little dear," repeated the woman, and
kissed her again. That kiss roused the child.
Opening her eyes, she threw her arms around
the woman's neck, exclaiming wildly,</p>

<p>"My mother, oh, my mother!"</p>

<p>"But I am not your mother, dear," remonstrated
the woman, trying to release herself
from the clinging arms. "I am Florence
Weston's mother. I have come for her little
satchel that we forgot. Cuddle down, dear,
and go to sleep again."</p>

<p>At that, Marian seemed to realize her mistake
and cried so pitifully, Florence Weston's
mother took her in her arms and sitting in a
low rocker held Marian and tried to quiet her.</p>

<p>The door opened and Florence entered.
"Why mamma, what is the matter?" she began,
but without waiting for a reply, she was
gone, returning in a moment with her father.
"Now what is the matter with poor Marian?"
she repeated.</p>

<p>"Nothing," explained Marian, "only everything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"She thought I was her mother, Florence,
the poor little girl; there, there, dear, don't
cry. She was only half awake and she says I
look like her mother's picture."</p>

<p>"You do, you look just like the picture,"
sobbed Marian.</p>

<p>"What picture?" asked the man; "this
child is the image of brother. What picture,
I say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she means mamma's miniature," said
Florence.</p>

<p>"I don't mean the miniature," Marian interrupted,
"I mean my own mother's picture,"
and the child, kneeling before her small trunk
quickly found the photograph of her father
and mother. "There! doesn't she look like
my mother?"</p>

<p>There was a moment of breathless silence
as Florence Weston's father and mother gazed
at the small card. The woman was the first
to speak.</p>

<p>"Why, Richard Lee!" she exclaimed.
"That must be a photograph of you!"</p>

<p>"It is," was the reply, "it is a picture of
me and of my dead wife, but the baby died too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I didn't die," cried Marian. "I was
two months old when my father went away,
and when my mother died, the folks wrote to
the place where my father was the last time
they knew anything about him, and I s'pose
they told him I was dead, but I wasn't, and
that's my mother. Uncle George knows
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle George, my brother George," for a
moment it was the man who seemed to be
dreaming. Then a light broke over his face
as he snatched Marian and said, "Why, little
girl, you are my child."</p>

<p>"And my mother will be your mother,"
Florence put in, "so what are you and mamma
crying about now?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you ever hear," said Marian, smiling
through her tears, "that sometimes folks
cry for joy?"</p>

<p>It was unnecessary for Aunt Amelia to take
the long journey. Marian's father telegraphed
for Uncle George who arrived the next day
with papers Marian knew nothing about,
proving beyond question the identity of the
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>The little girl couldn't understand the silent
greeting between the brothers, nor why Uncle
George was so deeply affected when she talked
of his kindness to her and the many happy
days she thanked him for since he found her
in the Little Pilgrims' Home. Neither could
she understand what her father meant when
he spoke of a debt of gratitude too deep for
words.</p>

<p>Marian only knew that unpleasant memories
slipped away like a dream when Uncle George
left her with her father and mother: when he
smiled and told her he was glad she was going
home.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
